## CRITICAL: Log Review Protocol

**NEVER GUESS AT ISSUES. ALWAYS REVIEW LOGS FIRST.**

When debugging production/deployment issues:

1. **MANDATORY**: Before making ANY code changes to fix an issue, you MUST:
   - Access and review actual deployment logs (Railway: `railway logs -n 200 --service <service>`)
   - Identify the EXACT error message from the logs
   - Understand the root cause from the logs, not from assumptions

2. **FORBIDDEN**: You must NEVER:
   - Make code changes based on guesses about what might be wrong
   - Assume an issue is caused by X without log evidence
   - Modify valid working code to "fix" a guessed problem
   - Run tests repeatedly hoping something works without understanding why it failed

3. **When running tests/demos that fail**:
   - STOP immediately
   - Check the relevant service logs (api-dev, worker-dev, infra-api-dev)
   - Find the actual error in the logs
   - Only then propose/make a fix based on the real error

4. **Railway CLI access**:
   - `railway service status --all` - list all services
   - `railway logs -n 200 --service <name>` - get recent logs
   - Always verify you can access logs before debugging deployment issues

This rule exists because guessing at fixes has caused valid code to be broken. Log-driven debugging is mandatory.
