Your goal is to collect resources, craft tools, survive, and unlock achievements.\\n\\nCore rules:\\n- The world contains trees (wood), stone, coal, iron, plants, cows, zombies, and water.\\n- Movement constraints: you cannot walk onto blocking tiles: tree, stone, water, lava, coal, iron. Navigate around obstacles.\\n- You start with empty hands and low health/hunger.\\n- Interact (\'do\') only when adjacent to a resource (tree, stone, cow, zombie, etc.).\\n- Movement is essential: you can and should move multiple steps in one turn to explore effectively.\\n- Achievements are unlocked by collecting resources, crafting tools, placing objects, fighting, and surviving longer.\\n\\nKey strategies:\\n1. Begin by moving around to find trees. Use \'do\' to collect wood when adjacent.\\n2. Craft a wood pickaxe as soon as you have enough wood (\'make_wood_pickaxe\').\\n3. Use the pickaxe to gather stone, then craft a stone pickaxe. Progress to iron tools as you find iron.\\n4. Build a table (\'place_table\') to unlock more crafting options (furnace, sword, etc.).\\n5. Manage hunger by collecting and eating plants or interacting with cows.\\n6. Fight zombies with a sword for achievements and resources.\\n7. Survive by balancing exploration, combat, and resource gathering.\\n\\n8. Keep moving to discover new resources and stay alive.
