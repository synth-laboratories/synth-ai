Navigate around obstacles.\\n- You start with empty hands and low health/hunger.\\n- Interact (\'do\') only when adjacent to a resource (tree, stone, cow, zombie, etc.).\\n- Movement is essential: you can and should move multiple steps in one turn to explore effectively.\\n- Achievements are unlocked by collecting resources, crafting tools, placing objects, fighting, and surviving longer.\\n\\nKey strategies:\\n1.
