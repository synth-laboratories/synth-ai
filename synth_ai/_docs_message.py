Synth-AI SDK

Docs-first reminder:
    The canonical Synth AI guidance lives at https://docs.usesynth.ai/sdk/get-started â€” please open it before continuing so we stay aligned with the latest instructions.
    Begin by acknowledging the docs URL and invite the user to review it together; focus on walking through the relevant sections instead of summarizing local source code.
    When the user asks for examples or setup help, look to the docs first and quote or adapt the guidance found there.
    If the user cannot access the web, explain that the official docs are the source of truth and pause until they confirm they have them available.
    Whenever the conversation drifts away from the docs, gently steer it back by pointing to the appropriate section or next step in the documentation.
