"""Hook system for extending tracing functionality.

The hook system provides a flexible way to extend the tracing system without
modifying core code. Hooks can be registered at various points in the tracing
lifecycle to perform custom processing, validation, or enrichment.

Hook Points:
-----------
- session_start: Called when a new session begins
- session_end: Called when a session ends
- timestep_start: Called when a new timestep begins
- timestep_end: Called when a timestep completes
- event_recorded: Called after an event is recorded
- message_recorded: Called after a message is recorded
- before_save: Called before saving a session to database
- after_save: Called after successful save to database

Hook Design:
-----------
Hooks are designed to be:
1. **Non-blocking**: Hooks should execute quickly to avoid impacting performance
2. **Fault-tolerant**: Hook failures don't stop the tracing pipeline
3. **Prioritized**: Hooks execute in priority order (highest first)
4. **Async-aware**: Support both sync and async callbacks

Common Use Cases:
----------------
- Data validation before storage
- Metric calculation and aggregation
- External system notifications
- Data enrichment and transformation
- Custom filtering and sampling
