"""Core data structures for tracing v3.

This module defines the fundamental data structures used throughout the tracing system.
All structures are implemented as frozen dataclasses for immutability and type safety.

The hierarchy is designed to support different types of events while maintaining
a consistent interface for storage and processing.

Event Type Hierarchy:
-------------------
- BaseEvent: Common fields for all events
  - RuntimeEvent: Events from the runtime system (e.g., actions taken)
  - EnvironmentEvent: Events from the environment (e.g., rewards, termination)
  - LMCAISEvent: Language model events with token/cost tracking

Session Structure:
-----------------
- SessionTrace: Top-level container for a complete session
  - SessionTimeStep: Logical steps within a session (e.g., conversation turns)
    - Events: Individual events that occurred during the timestep
    - Messages: Information passed between subsystems (user, agent, runtime, environments)

Concepts:
---------
- Events capture something that happened inside a subsystem. They may or may not be externally
  visible. Examples include an LLM API call (LMCAISEvent), a tool selection (RuntimeEvent), or
  a tool execution outcome (EnvironmentEvent).

- Messages represent information transmitted between subsystems within the session.
  Messages are used to record communications like: a user sending input to the agent,
  the agent/runtime sending a tool invocation to an environment, the environment sending a
  tool result back, and the agent sending a reply to the user. Do not confuse these with
  provider-specific LLM API "messages" (prompt formatting) â€” those belong inside an LMCAISEvent
  as part of its input/output content, not as SessionEventMessages.

                   primary timestamp used for ordering and correlation.

class SessionEventMarkovBlanketMessage:

    IMPORTANT: This represents information transfer BETWEEN distinct systems/subsystems,
    where each system is conceptualized as having a Markov blanket that separates its
    internal states from the external environment. These messages cross those boundaries.
    
    This is NOT for chat messages within an LLM conversation (those belong in LLMCallRecord).
    Instead, this captures inter-system communication such as:
    - Human -> Agent system (user providing instructions)
    - Agent -> Runtime (agent deciding on an action)
    - Runtime -> Environment (executing a tool/action)
    - Environment -> Runtime (returning results)
    - Runtime -> Agent (passing back results)
    - Agent -> Human (final response)
    
    Each system maintains its own internal state and processing, but can only influence
    other systems through these explicit boundary-crossing messages. This follows the
    Free Energy Principle where systems minimize surprise by maintaining boundaries.
    
    Attributes:
        content: The actual message content crossing the boundary (text, JSON, etc.)
        message_type: Type of boundary crossing (e.g., 'observation', 'action', 'result')
