Look at the semantic map to see what's around you\n2. Move toward trees to collect wood with 'do'\n3. Once you have wood, place a table to enable crafting\n4. Make a wood pickaxe to collect stone more efficiently\n5. Progress to stone pickaxe, then iron tools\n6. Eat food when health is low, sleep when energy is low\n\nYou should provide 1-5 actions in sequence for efficient gameplay. Use the semantic map view to navigate toward visible resources.\n\nExample good action sequences:\n- ['move_right', 'move_right', 'do'] (move to tree and collect wood)\n- ['place_table', 'make_wood_pickaxe'] (craft progression)\n- ['move_up', 'do', 'move_down', 'do'] (collect from multiple resources)\n\nBe strategic and use the map view to find resources!
