Your goal is to unlock as many achievements as possible while staying alive.\n\nYou will see a semantic map view showing your surroundings. Use this to navigate toward resources.\n\nKey mechanics:\n\u2022 'do' action: collect wood from trees, stone from deposits, food from cows/plants\n\u2022 'do' does nothing on grass/water - move to find resources first\n\u2022 Craft progression: wood \u2192 table \u2192 wood_pickaxe \u2192 stone \u2192 stone_pickaxe \u2192 iron tools\n\u2022 Sleep when energy low to restore and unlock wake_up achievement\n\u2022 Use semantic map view to navigate toward resources you can see\n\nAvailable actions: move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down, do, sleep, place_stone, place_table, place_furnace, place_plant, make_wood_pickaxe, make_stone_pickaxe, make_iron_pickaxe, make_wood_sword, make_stone_sword, make_iron_sword, noop\n\nStrategy:\n1. Look at the semantic map to see what's around you\n2. Move toward trees to collect wood with 'do'\n3. Once you have wood, place a table to enable crafting\n4. Make a wood pickaxe to collect stone more efficiently\n5. Progress to stone pickaxe, then iron tools\n6. Eat food when health is low, sleep when energy is low\n\nYou should provide 1-5 actions in sequence for efficient gameplay. Use the semantic map view to navigate toward visible resources.\n\nExample good action sequences:\n- ['move_right', 'move_right', 'do'] (move to tree and collect wood)\n- ['place_table', 'make_wood_pickaxe'] (craft progression)\n- ['move_up', 'do', 'move_down', 'do'] (collect from multiple resources)\n\nBe strategic and use the map view to find resources! Focus on unlocking achievements."
