Make a wood pickaxe to collect stone more efficiently\n5. Progress to stone pickaxe, then iron tools\n6. Eat food when health is low, sleep when energy is low\n\nYou should provide 1-5 actions in sequence for efficient gameplay. Use the semantic map view to navigate toward visible resources.\n\nExample good action sequences:\n- ['move_right', 'move_right', 'do'] (move to tree and collect wood)\n- ['place_table', 'make_wood_pickaxe'] (craft progression)\n- ['move_up', 'do', 'move_down', 'do'] (collect from multiple resources)\n\nBe strategic and use the map view to find resources!

Look at the semantic map to see what's around you\n2. Move toward trees to collect wood with 'do'\n3. Once you have wood, place a table to enable crafting\n4. Make a wood pickaxe to collect stone more efficiently\n5. Progress to stone pickaxe, then iron tools\n6. Eat food when health is low, sleep when energy is low\n\nYou should provide 1-5 actions in sequence for efficient gameplay. Use the semantic map view to navigate toward visible resources.\n\nExample good action sequences:\n- ['move_right', 'move_right', 'do'] (move to tree and collect wood)\n- ['place_table', 'make_wood_pickaxe'] (craft progression)\n- ['move_up', 'do', 'move_down', 'do'] (collect from multiple resources)\n\nBe strategic and use the map view to find resources!

Look at the semantic map to see what's around you\n2. Move toward trees to collect wood with 'do'\n3. Once you have wood, place a table to enable crafting\n4. Make a wood pickaxe to collect stone more efficiently\n5. Progress to stone pickaxe, then iron tools\n6. Eat food when health is low, sleep when energy is low\n\nYou should provide 1-5 actions in sequence for efficient gameplay. Use the semantic map view to navigate toward visible resources.\n\nExample good action sequences:\n- ['move_right', 'move_right', 'do'] (move to tree and collect wood)\n- ['place_table', 'make_wood_pickaxe'] (craft progression)\n- ['move_up', 'do', 'move_down', 'do'] (collect from multiple resources)\n\nBe strategic and use the map view to find resources!
