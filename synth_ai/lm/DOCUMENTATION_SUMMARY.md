9. **caching/persistent.py**
   - Added module-level docstring explaining persistent caching
   - Added class docstring for `PersistentCache`
   - Added method docstrings for `hit_cache()`, `add_to_cache()`, and `close()`

### Vendor Implementations

11. **vendors/openai_standard.py**
    - Added docstring to `special_orion_transform()` function
    - Added comprehensive class docstring for `OpenAIStandard`
    - Documented the retry logic and model-specific handling

12. **vendors/core/openai_api.py**
    - Added module-level docstring
    - Added comment explaining the retry exceptions
    - Added class docstring for `OpenAIStructuredOutputClient`

## Documentation Style

The documentation follows these conventions:
- Module-level docstrings use triple quotes and explain the module's purpose
- Class docstrings include a brief description and document key attributes
- Method/function docstrings include:
  - Brief description
  - Args section with parameter descriptions
  - Returns section with return value description
  - Optional Notes section for important details
  - Optional Raises section for exceptions
- Inline comments are used for complex logic or important constants

## Areas Still Needing Documentation

Several files still need documentation:
- Other vendor implementations (anthropic_api.py, gemini_api.py, etc.)
- The inject.py and rehabilitate.py modules have complex logic that would benefit from inline comments
- The warmup.py and unified_interface.py modules already have good docstrings
- Empty files like caching/__init__.py and caching/dbs.py don't need documentation
- The cost/monitor.py file only contains "# TODO" and needs implementation

This documentation improves code maintainability and helps developers understand the module's architecture and functionality.
