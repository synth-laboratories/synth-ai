"""Rubric schema, loading, and scoring helpers for Task Apps.

This module provides:
- Flexible rubric models (Criterion, Rubric) for general task app use
- Strict validators (StrictCriterion, StrictRubric) for step-wise judges
- Loading utilities supporting JSON, YAML, and HTTP sources
- Blending utilities for composing rubrics
- Scoring utilities for events and outcomes
