# Qwen3 0.6B Test Results on Synth Backend

## Test Execution Summary

Successfully tested Qwen3 0.6B model on Synth backend with the following results:

### ✅ Working Features (2/5 test categories)

#### 1. GPU Warmup - 100% Success
- **L40S GPU**: Warmed up in 1.68s ✅
- **A10G GPU**: Warmed up in 20.71s ✅
- Both GPUs successfully initialized for Qwen3 0.6B

#### 2. Inference - 100% Success  
- **L40S GPU**: 3/3 prompts successful
  - Average response time: 5.47s
  - All responses generated correctly
- **A10G GPU**: 3/3 prompts successful
  - Average response time: 6.08s
  - All responses generated correctly
- Total: 6/6 inference requests successful

### ❌ Not Available Features (3/5 test categories)

#### 3. Fine-tuning - Not Available
- File upload endpoint (`/api/v1/files`) returns 404
- Backend doesn't currently support fine-tuning operations

#### 4. DPO Training - Not Available
- File upload endpoint (`/api/v1/files`) returns 404
- DPO training endpoints not implemented

#### 5. Fine-tuned Model Inference - Not Available
- Depends on fine-tuning/DPO being available first

## Key Findings

### Model Compatibility
- **Qwen3 0.6B** confirmed working on Synth backend
- **Compatible GPUs**: A10G, L40S only
- **Incompatible GPUs**: A100, H100 (return 400 error)

### API Endpoints Status
| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/warmup/{model}` | ✅ Working | GPU selection via header works |
| `/api/warmup/status/{model}` | ✅ Working | Returns warmup status |
| `/api/v1/chat/completions` | ✅ Working | GPU preference in body works |
| `/api/v1/files` | ❌ 404 | Not implemented |
| `/api/v1/fine_tuning/jobs` | ❌ Blocked | Needs file upload |
| `/api/v1/dpo/jobs` | ❌ Blocked | Needs file upload |

### Performance Metrics
- **Warmup Times**:
  - L40S: 1.68 seconds (faster)
  - A10G: 20.71 seconds (slower)
  
- **Inference Times** (average per request):
  - L40S: 5.47 seconds
  - A10G: 6.08 seconds

### GPU Selection Feature
✅ **Header-based GPU selection** (`X-GPU-Preference`) works correctly
✅ **Body-based GPU selection** (`gpu_preference`) works correctly
✅ **GPU validation** - Backend correctly rejects incompatible GPUs

## Test Configuration Used
```python
Model: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
API URL: http://localhost:8000
API Key: sk_live_9592524d-be1b-48b2-aff7-976b277eac95
Compatible GPUs: ["L40S", "A10G"]
```

## Conclusion

The Synth backend successfully supports:
1. **GPU warmup** for Qwen3 0.6B on compatible GPUs
2. **Inference** with GPU selection as specified in monorepo docs
3. **Proper GPU validation** and error handling

Currently not available:
1. Fine-tuning capabilities (file upload endpoint missing)
2. DPO training (file upload endpoint missing)
3. Custom model deployment

The core inference pipeline is functional and performant with Qwen3 0.6B model.
