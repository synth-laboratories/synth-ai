        "predict.predict": "Classify Heart Disease Based on Patient Features:\n\nThe task involves predicting whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical features. The input will be a set of patient measurements and medical data, and the output should be a classification of 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (heart disease).\n\nThe patient features will include:\n- Age: The patient's age, which is a risk factor for heart disease, with ages 45-60 considered moderately high risk.\n- Sex: The patient's sex, with males being at higher risk for heart disease.\n- CP (Chest Pain Type): A value from 1 to 4, where:\n  - 1: Typical angina ( chests pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart)\n  - 2: Atypical angina (chest pain not caused by reduced blood flow to the heart)\n  - 3: Non-anginal pain (chest pain not related to the heart)\n  - 4: Asymptomatic (no chest pain)\n- Trestbps: The patient's resting blood pressure, which is considered high if above 140 mmHg.\n- Chol: The patient's cholesterol level, which is considered high if above 200 mg/dL.\n- Fbs: The patient's fasting blood sugar level, which is considered high if above 120 mg/dL.\n- Restecg: The results of the resting electrocardiogram, where:\n  - 0: Normal\n  - 1: ST-T wave abnormality\n  - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy\n- Thalach: The patient's maximum heart rate achieved, which is considered high if above 150 beats per minute.\n- Exang: Whether the patient experiences chest pain during exercise (0: no, 1: yes).\n- Oldpeak: The patient's ST depression induced by exercise, which is considered high if above 1 mm.\n- Slope: The slope of the ST segment during exercise, where:\n  - 1: Upsloping\n  - 2: Flat\n  - 3: Downsloping\n- Ca: The number of major blood vessels affected by coronary artery disease.\n- Thal: The patient's thalassemia status, where:\n  - Normal: No thalassemia\n  - Fixed: Fixed thalassemia\n  - Reversible: Reversible thalassemia\n\nTo classify the patient, you can use a simple threshold-based approach, where a patient with three or more risk factors is classified as having heart disease (1). The risk factors are:\n- Age above 45\n- Male sex\n- High cholesterol\n- High blood pressure\n- High ST depression induced by exercise\n- Upsloping or flat ST slope\n- Presence of chest pain during exercise\n- High maximum heart rate achieved\n\nYou can also consider other factors, such as the patient's chest pain type, resting electrocardiogram results, and thalassemia status, to make a more informed classification.\n\nExample inputs and outputs are provided below:\n### features\nage: 37\nsex: 1\ncp: 3\ntrestbps: 130\nchol: 250\nfbs: 0\nrestecg: 0\nthalach: 187\nexang: 0\noldpeak: 3.5\nslope: 3\nca: 0\nthal: normal\n\n### classification\n1\n\nYour task is to classify the patient based on their features and provide a detailed reasoning for your classification."
