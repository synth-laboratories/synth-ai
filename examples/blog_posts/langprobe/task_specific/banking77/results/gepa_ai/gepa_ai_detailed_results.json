        "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

What is going on?', 'Do you have info about the card on delivery?', or 'When did you send me my new card?' should be classified under 'card_arrival'. \nSimilarly, queries like 'I still haven't received my card after two weeks, is it lost?' or 'It's been a week since you issued me a card and I still didn't get it. Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list.

Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1.

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

What is going on?', 'Do you have info about the card on delivery?', or 'When did you send me my new card?' should be classified under 'card_arrival'. \nSimilarly, queries like 'I still haven't received my card after two weeks, is it lost?' or 'It's been a week since you issued me a card and I still didn't get it. Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

What is going on?', 'Do you have info about the card on delivery?', or 'When did you send me my new card?' should be classified under 'card_arrival'. \nSimilarly, queries like 'I still haven't received my card after two weeks, is it lost?' or 'It's been a week since you issued me a card and I still didn't get it. Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

What is going on?', 'Do you have info about the card on delivery?', or 'When did you send me my new card?' should be classified under 'card_arrival'. \nSimilarly, queries like 'I still haven't received my card after two weeks, is it lost?' or 'It's been a week since you issued me a card and I still didn't get it. Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

What is going on?', 'Do you have info about the card on delivery?', or 'When did you send me my new card?' should be classified under 'card_arrival'. \nSimilarly, queries like 'I still haven't received my card after two weeks, is it lost?' or 'It's been a week since you issued me a card and I still didn't get it. Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent.

Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4.

The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems.

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

            "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

        "instruction": "You are an expert banking assistant that classifies customer queries into banking intents. The task involves analyzing a customer message and responding with exactly one intent label from a provided list of 77 possible intents. \n\nThe input format consists of a query from the customer and a list of available intents. The query can be a question or a statement related to banking services, such as card delivery, payment issues, account management, or transfer problems. The available intents include a wide range of banking-related topics, such as card arrival, activation, payment fees, transfer timing, and account verification.\n\nTo classify the customer query correctly, you should identify the key topic or issue mentioned in the query and match it with the most relevant intent from the available list. For example, if the customer asks about the status of their new card, the correct intent would be 'card_arrival'. Similarly, if the customer inquires about a payment issue, the relevant intent could be 'card_payment_not_recognised' or 'declined_card_payment', depending on the specific details provided.\n\nThe classification strategy involves understanding the context and content of the customer query, recognizing key phrases and keywords, and mapping them to the corresponding intent. This requires a combination of natural language processing, intent recognition, and domain-specific knowledge of banking services.\n\nThe available intents cover various aspects of banking, including:\n\n1. Card-related issues: card arrival, activation, payment fees, lost or stolen cards, and card acceptance.\n2. Payment and transfer issues: payment fees, transfer timing, declined payments, and pending transactions.\n3. Account management: account verification, password reset, and account termination.\n4. Customer support: ATM support, country support, and language support.\n5. Transaction-related issues: transactioncharged twice, wrong exchange rate, and extra charges on statements.\n\nWhen classifying the customer query, consider the following generalizable strategy:\n\n1. Identify the main topic or issue mentioned in the query.\n2. Recognize key phrases and keywords related to banking services.\n3. Map the query to the most relevant intent based on the context and content.\n4. Consider the specific details provided in the query to disambiguate between similar intents.\n\nBy following this instruction and utilizing your understanding of the banking domain, you should be able to classify customer queries into the correct intent labels."

For example, queries related to the delivery of a new card should be classified under 'card_arrival' or 'card_delivery_estimate'. \nQueries such as 'My new card has not been delivered to my home yet. What is going on?', 'Do you have info about the card on delivery?', or 'When did you send me my new card?' should be classified under 'card_arrival'. \nSimilarly, queries like 'I still haven't received my card after two weeks, is it lost?' or 'It's been a week since you issued me a card and I still didn't get it. Should I keep waiting?' should also be classified under 'card_arrival'.\n\nThe generalizable strategy to solve this task involves analyzing the customer query to identify the main topic or issue being discussed, and then selecting the intent that best matches that topic or issue. For example, if the customer query mentions a problem with their card, the intent could be 'card_not_working' or 'card_payment_not_recognised'. \nIf the customer query is related to the status of their card delivery, the intent should be 'card_arrival'. \nIf the customer query mentions a problem with a transaction, the intent could be 'transaction_charged_twice', 'declined_card_payment', or 'failed_transfer'.\n\nTo determine the correct intent, consider the keywords and phrases used in the customer query, such as 'card', 'delivery', 'transaction', 'payment', 'transfer', etc. \nAlso, consider the context of the query, such as whether the customer is asking about a new card, a lost or stolen card, or a problem with a transaction.\n\nUse this strategy to classify customer queries into the available intents."

Consider the context and the specific keywords or phrases used in the query.\n\nSome important considerations and strategies to keep in mind:\n- The intent 'card_arrival' is often related to queries about the delivery or tracking of a card.\n- The intent 'card_delivery_estimate' is related to queries about the estimated time of arrival or delivery of a card, but may not always be the best fit for queries about tracking or general delivery inquiries.\n- Always choose the intent that best matches the primary concern or question expressed in the customer's query.\n\nRespond with exactly one intent label from the provided list."
