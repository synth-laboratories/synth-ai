For example, if the query mentions \"tracking\" and \"card delivery\", it is likely related to the 'card_arrival' or 'card_delivery_estimate' intent.\n\nWhen analyzing the query, look for specific keywords or phrases that match the available intents. Use a generalizable strategy to narrow down the possible intents based on the query's context and content. Consider the customer's concern or question and match it with the most relevant intent.\n\nProvide the predicted intent as the output, and include a clear explanation of the reasoning behind the prediction. \n\nExample Inputs:\n### query\nIs there a way to track the delivery of my card?\n### available_intents\n1. activate_my_card\n2. age_limit\n...\n77. wrong_exchange_rate_for_cash_withdrawal\n\nExample Outputs:\n### reasoning\nThe customer query \"Is there a way to track the delivery of my card?\" is related to the delivery or arrival of their debit/credit card from the bank. We can look at the available intents to identify the closest match. Intent 12 'card_arrival' indicates the customer's interest in knowing or tracking the arrival status of their card. Similarly, intent 13 'card_delivery_estimate' may provide information about the estimated time of delivery. However, since the query focuses on 'tracking the delivery,' intent 13 seems more relevant.\n### intent\ncard_delivery_estimate"

The query string can contain keywords or phrases that indicate the customer's concern, such as \"where is my card,\" \"I haven't received my card,\" or \"my card is lost.\"\n\nA suitable strategy to solve this task is to identify the key phrases or keywords in the query string and match them to the available intents. For example, if the query string contains the phrase \"where is my card,\" the correct intent is likely to be \"card_arrival.\" If the query string contains the phrase \"I haven't received my card,\" the correct intent could be either \"card_arrival\" or \"lost_or_stolen_card,\" depending on the context.\n\nIn general, the task requires a deep understanding of the banking domain and the ability to analyze the query string to determine the correct intent. The assistant should be able to identify the key phrases or keywords in the query string and match them to the available intents, taking into account the context and the specific details of the query."

The query may include phrases that explicitly or implicitly indicate the intent. For instance, phrases like 'I have been waiting over a week' or 'is the card still coming' can indicate a query related to the expected delivery of a card.\n\nTo solve this task, analyze the customer query to identify the most relevant intent. The analysis may involve:\n- Identifying key phrases or words in the query\n- Understanding the context of the query\n- Matching the query with the available intents\n- Eliminating intents that are less relevant to the query\n\nSome generalizable strategies to solve this task include:\n- Using natural language processing techniques to analyze the query\n- Utilizing machine learning models to classify the query into one of the available intents\n- Developing a knowledge graph to represent the relationships between the intents and the customer queries\n\nThe output should include a clear explanation of the reasoning behind the predicted intent and the predicted intent itself.\n\nIn particular, the following phrases can be used to identify specific intents:\n- \"When will I receive my new card?\" or \"When will I get my new card?\" can indicate a query related to the 'card_arrival' intent.\n- \"Can you tell me why I haven't received my new card?\" can indicate a query related to either 'card_arrival' or 'card_delivery_estimate' intent.\n- The key phrase \"new card\" can be associated with the delivery of a card.\n\nThe model should be able to handle minor spelling or formatting errors in the query, such as \"When will I recieve my new card?\"."
