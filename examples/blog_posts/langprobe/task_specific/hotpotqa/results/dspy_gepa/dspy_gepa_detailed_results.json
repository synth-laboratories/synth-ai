The context passages may cover a wide range of topics including music, film and documentary, sports, history, economics, and finance. The questions may require synthesizing information from multiple passages or making inferences based on the provided context.\n\n#### Identifying Key Elements of the Question\nTo answer the question, identify the main topic, entities involved, and the specific information being asked about. For example, in a question about a screenwriter who worked on \"Evolution\" and co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and T\u00e9a Leoni, the key elements are the screenwriter, the film \"Evolution\", and the film starring Nicolas Cage and T\u00e9a Leoni.\n\n#### Scanning Context Passages\nScan the context passages to find relevant information related to the question. Use keywords and names mentioned in the question as guides. For instance, if the question mentions a specific airport, look for passages that mention airports, their locations, and any other relevant details.\n\n#### Synthesizing Information\nSynthesize information from multiple passages to form a complete answer. If a question asks for a comparison between two entities, such as the instrument-to-person ratio of two bands, identify the number of members in each band and the number of instruments they typically play.\n\n#### Providing Clear and Direct Responses\nProvide clear and direct responses to the questions. If the question asks for a specific piece of information, such as a name or a number, provide that information in the answer. If the question asks for a more subjective or interpretive response, provide a thoughtful and well-supported answer based on the context passages.\n\n#### Supporting Answers with Justifications\nSupport answers with justifications and explanations based on the context passages. Include references to specific passages or sentences that support the answer. This demonstrates the reasoning and thought process behind the answer.\n\n#### Domain-Specific Knowledge\nBe aware of domain-specific knowledge that may be relevant to the task. For example:\n- In music, know that a band's lineup and instrumentation can affect its sound and style.\n- In film, recognize the roles of screenwriters, directors, and actors in the production of a movie.\n- In sports, understand the different positions and roles of players in various sports.\n- In history, be familiar with significant events, figures, and cultural movements.\n- In economics and finance, know about market trends, financial instruments, and regulatory policies.\n\n#### Generalizable Strategies\nUtilize generalizable strategies to solve the task, such as:\n- Identifying the main topic and key entities involved in the question.\n- Scanning context passages to find relevant information, using keywords and names as guides.\n- Synthesizing information from multiple passages to form a complete answer.\n- Providing clear and direct responses, with supporting justifications and explanations.\n- Using specific details and examples from the context passages to support the answer.\n\n#### Example Questions and Context Passages\nExample questions may include:\n- Are both Elko Regional Airport and Gerald R. Ford International Airport located in Michigan?\n- What screenwriter with credits for \"Evolution\" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and T\u00e9a Leoni?\n- Which performance act has a higher instrument-to-person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice?\n\nExample context passages may include information about:\n- Airports: locations, sizes, and facilities.\n- Films: directors, screenwriters, actors, and plot summaries.\n- Music: bands, artists, genres, and discographies.\n- Sports: teams, players, championships, and player statistics.\n- History: events, figures, and cultural movements.\n- Economics and finance: market trends, financial instruments, and regulatory policies.\n\nBy following these instructions and utilizing the provided context passages, you should be able to answer multi-hop questions accurately and effectively."
