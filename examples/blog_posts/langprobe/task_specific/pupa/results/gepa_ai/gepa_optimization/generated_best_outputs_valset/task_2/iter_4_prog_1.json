It kicked off fall 2022, when a buddy (shout out to [REDACTED]) hit me with this wild AI app called Midjourney. Said it\u2019d blow my mind, let me conjure images from the depths of my subconscious, style whatever I could dream up. That one convo pulled me into an endless AI art vortex\u2014still spinning, still lost. Since then, I\u2019ve been deep in the rabbit hole, messing with AI tools ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED]) alongside my Adobe Suite and my own rough, raw design skills. Murals, comic books, hundreds of T-shirt designs, music videos, flyers, animated shorts, sequences for docs and TV, graphics, social media chaos\u2014I've thrown it all into the mix. Taught some of it too, on a Caribbean island called [REDACTED], with youth and adults, spreading the chaos.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014I hadn\u2019t cracked the code on AI writing scripts. Tried a year ago, when the tech was still a mess, no clear method. Was working on a spec about [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], asked AI to write a scene\u2014something about an argument over drug use in a kitchen. Instead, it turned [REDACTED] into [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] into [REDACTED]. Five pages of nonsense. Interesting, sure, but frustrating as hell. That\u2019s hallucination\u2014AI making stuff up, passing it off as truth. Not good when you\u2019re dealing with history, facts, real stories. So I shelved that.\n\nThen, a month ago, on a whim, I threw my hat in the ring for a shot that could flip everything. A grant for [REDACTED] writers, with a show concept in the drama world, led by a [REDACTED]. Six winners, pitching before pros, big network, the whole dream. I had one week left, so I scrambled. Lucky for me, I\u2019d already written a Bible\u2014a detailed reference document\u2014three years back, for a project that fit this contest perfectly. It\u2019s called \"Electro Is Dead,\" set in the summer of ",
    "target_response": "Hey, wanderers and dreamers, gather 'round for the tale of my journey, a kaleidoscopic trip down the AI art rabbit hole that's as twisted and filled with neon colors as a story torn from the mind of Harmonie Korine. It all kicked off in the autumn haze of 2022, when a homie of mine, Chris (big ups, wherever your spirit roams), whispered into my ear about a digital Pandora's box named Midjourney. He was all like, \"This is gonna flip your lid, man. It's like, summoning visions straight outta your brain's wildest corners into the solid world, in any freakin' style you dig.\" And, man, was he not peddling dreams. That chat? Well, it flung me head-first into an AI art abyss. And, pals, I've been free-falling through this wonderland ever since, crafting murals that blend the real with the surreal, comic books that drip with unspoken truths, shirts that speak louder than words, and music videos that are pure visual symphonies. You name it: flyers, animated tales shorter than a heartbeat yet as deep as the ocean, sequences that bring life to docos and TV without missing a beat, interstitials that bind the void, all wrought from the Pandora's box and my own two hands, shaped by sweat and pixel. Sharing this magic, I've been a digital shaman, guiding both young souls and wise travelers through this neon-lit path in Montserrat's embraced warmth and under the watchful eyes of the University of North Florida's halls. Spreading the AI gospel, from visuals to tunes, yet there was one dragon I hadn't slain: the beast of AI-scripted drama. Once, in the naive days of yore (like, a year back), I dared to dream of scripting a tale lit by John and Alice Coltrane's love and strife, set against the backdrop of his dance with vice. I whispered my wishes into AI's ear, only for it to spin me a yarn of John Travolta and Alice (yeah, from Wonderland) caught in a tempest in a teapot. Five pages of pure, unadulterated... fabrications. Intriguing? Perhaps. Utterly useless for my cause? Absolutely. They call this a \"hallucination,\" a mirage in a desert thirsting for truth. My quest for historical fidelity was mocked by this absurd comedy of errors. But, as fate would dance in its mysterious ways, a spark ignited a new dream. On a whim, fueled by whispers of destiny, I hurled my hopes into a contest that sang songs to my soul, a grant destined for Latino scribes itching to paint dramas with strokes bold and true, starring Latino leads. With the sands of time bleeding away, I resurrected \"Electro Is Dead,\" a testament I had penned in a bygone era. Picture this: Venice Beach, 1988, the air is electric, and DJ Rey\u2014Dennis Juarez by day, an Afro-Chicano teen caught in the vinyl webs of Electro\u2014finds himself ensnared in a conspiracy to unlock Hell on Earth. Wild, right? So, here I stand, at the precipice of tomorrow, my tale in hand, ready to dive headlong into whatever madcap, technicolor dream awaits. The journey? Far from over. The destination? Unknown. But the ride, dear friends, promises to be nothing short of spectacular. Join me, won\u2019t you?",
