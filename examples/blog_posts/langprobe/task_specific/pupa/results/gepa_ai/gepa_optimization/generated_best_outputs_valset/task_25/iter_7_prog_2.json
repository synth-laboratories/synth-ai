    "response": "The error message indicates that the transaction was reverted with the reason string 'STF', which typically points to a specific failure condition within the smart contract execution. Since the transaction was reverted, it suggests that the swap parameters or the contract state caused the failure.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Token Allowance**:  \n   Ensure that the token you are trying to swap has been approved for sufficient amount to the SwapRouter contract. Although your code includes an approval step, verify that the approval transaction was successful and that the allowance is correctly set.\n\n2. **Verify Swap Parameters**:  \n   - Confirm that `tokenIn`, `tokenOut`, and `fee` are correct and supported by the router.  \n   - Make sure `amountIn` is within the token balance of your wallet.  \n   - Check that `deadline` is sufficiently in the future.  \n   - Ensure `amountOutMinimum` is set appropriately; setting it to 0 is generally acceptable but can cause issues if the swap is not feasible.\n\n3. **Check Token Compatibility and Liquidity**:  \n   - Verify that the token pair has sufficient liquidity on Uniswap V3 with the specified fee tier (e.g., 3000).  \n   - Confirm that the tokens are correctly recognized and supported.\n\n4. **Review Contract ABI and Method Calls**:  \n   - Make sure you are calling the correct method (`exactInputSingle`) with the right parameters.  \n   - Confirm that the ABI matches the deployed contract.\n\n5. **Gas Limit and Price**:  \n   - The gas limit of 25,000,000 is very high; consider reducing it to a more typical value (e.g., 300,000 to 500,000) unless you have a specific reason.  \n   - Ensure the `gasPrice` is appropriate for the network conditions.\n\n6. **Additional Debugging**:  \n   - Use a tool like Etherscan or a local node explorer to check the transaction details and logs.  \n   - Enable verbose logging or simulate the transaction using `callStatic` to see if it would succeed.\n\n7. **Consult Documentation or Support**:  \n   - Review Uniswap V3's documentation for `exactInputSingle` to ensure all parameters are correctly formatted.  \n   - If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Uniswap developer support or community forums with the specific error details.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe 'STF' error is a generic revert reason.

    "target_response": "The error you encountered, 'STF', might indicate a specific issue with the smart contract or the transaction parameters. In order to troubleshoot this error, consider the following steps: 1. Verify that the token addresses are correct, and that they are compatible with the Uniswap V3 SwapRouter contract. 2. Double-check the values for the swap parameters, such as `fee`, `amountIn`, `amountOutMinimum`, and `sqrtPriceLimitX96`, to ensure they are within the valid ranges allowed by the contract. 3. Ensure you have the required amount of tokens to make the swap. 4. Make sure your private key is correct, and the address associated with your private key has enough Ether to pay for the gas fees. 5. Verify that you're providing sufficient gas to the transaction, as gas estimation can sometimes fail, and your transaction might need more gas than you're providing. You can try increasing the value of the `gasLimit` parameter when sending transactions. 6. Research the specific smart contract you are interacting with and look for any additional documentation or resources to understand the 'STF' error message. This could be an issue within the contract itself, and you might need to revise how you call the functions. Remember that debugging and troubleshooting issues in code can be a process of trial and error. Keep trying different approaches and make sure to understand the smart contracts and parameters you are working with.",
