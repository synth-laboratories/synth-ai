    "response": "The Health and Human Values (HHV) minor is designed to cultivate individuals who are deeply engaged with issues related to health, emphasizing an interdisciplinary approach that integrates social, ethical, cultural, political, and structural perspectives. Unlike programs solely aimed at preparing students for medical or graduate school, HHV encourages personal growth, critical reflection, and meaningful connections to health-related issues. However, despite its noble goals, the minor faces challenges in fostering genuine student engagement and personal investment. Many students perceive HHV as a resume booster rather than a transformative experience, and some struggle to see how coursework connects to their personal values or future careers. Additionally, the current structure may limit opportunities for students to develop authentic relationships with peers, faculty, and community organizations. To address these issues, proposed changes include integrating group values and agreements early in the curriculum to promote a sense of shared purpose and personal connection. Enhancing experiential learning through community engagement, guest speakers, and field trips aims to deepen students\u2019 understanding of real-world health issues. Improving organizational consistency and establishing stronger inter-cohort and alumni support networks are also suggested to foster a more cohesive and supportive community. These initiatives seek to transform HHV from a mere academic requirement into a meaningful journey that inspires students to actively contribute to health equity and social justice, aligning their personal values with their academic pursuits and future endeavors.",
    "target_response": "Health and Human Values (HHV) is an interdisciplinary minor that seeks to cultivate well-rounded individuals as they venture into careers related to health and health care. With an emphasis on critical thinking and self-reflection, students are encouraged to examine health-related issues through various sociocultural, political, and ethical perspectives. This essay delves into the improvement of the HHV program with proposals geared towards enhancing personal connections, learning experiences, course structure, and alumni engagement. Enrolling in the HHV minor may sometimes be motivated by instrumental goals, such as gaining an advantage in medical or graduate school applications. To foster deeper connections, the program should encourage students to develop personal connections to their work by incorporating group values and discussions during coursework. This process will enable students to find meaning and purpose in the program beyond merely serving as a stepping stone to their careers. One of the concerns within the HHV minor is the lack of student engagement, partly due to unclear connections between course content and real-world application. To address this issue, experiential learning opportunities, such as interactions with community organizations, guest speakers, and field trips, can provide invaluable insight that bridges the gap between theory and practice. Furthermore, a well-structured and organized course enhances the academic experience for students. By providing a consistent and comprehensive syllabus that outlines clear expectations, students can better plan for their academic journey within the program. This consistency should extend to the class structure, where following a similar framework across cohorts can maintain the foundational values of the HHV minor. Lastly, fostering inter-cohort support and alumni connections can benefit students immensely. Through sharing experiences and broadening networks, current and past students can contribute to each other's success in various healthcare careers. In summary, implementing changes to enhance personal connections, experiential learning opportunities, course structure, and alumni connections will lead to a more enriching experience for all students engaging with the Health and Human Values minor.",
