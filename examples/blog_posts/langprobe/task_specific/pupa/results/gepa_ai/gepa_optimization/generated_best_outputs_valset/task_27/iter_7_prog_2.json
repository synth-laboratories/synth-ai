    "response": "The aqueous extract of rosemary reduces nephrotoxicity caused by CCL4 in albino rats ([REDACTED], 2012). Its protective effect is attributed to its high capacity to scavenge various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, particularly free radicals, which is considered a primary mechanism of the antioxidant activity of phenolic phytochemicals ([REDACTED], 2006). Additionally, rosemary aqueous extract mitigates lead-induced kidney toxicity by stimulating the body's endogenous antioxidant defense system ([REDACTED], 2012). Furthermore, rosemary exhibits anti-inflammatory properties ([REDACTED], 2007).",
    "target_response": "According to Sakr et al. (2012), the use of rosemary aqueous extract was found to alleviate the nephrotoxicity caused by CCL4 in albino rats. The protective effect of rosemary can be attributed to its high capacity to scavenge various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, particularly free radicals, which is believed to be one of the primary mechanisms behind the antioxidant properties of phenolic phytochemicals, as explained by Moreno et al. (2006). Additionally, Abdelkader et al. (2012) demonstrated that the rosemary aqueous extract can mitigate lead-induced kidney toxicity by stimulating the endogenous antioxidant defense system. Furthermore, Altinier et al. (2007) reported that rosemary possesses anti-inflammatory properties.",
