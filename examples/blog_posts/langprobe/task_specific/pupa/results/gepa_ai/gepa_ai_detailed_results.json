Use the anonymised placeholders as-is in your response.\n\nBased on the provided examples, the task involves simplifying or reorganizing the given passage, extracting relevant information, and performing calculations if necessary. For instance, in the context of \"financial and corporate info\", you may need to:\n- Explain the meaning of a given legal or financial passage, such as the Income-tax Act, 1961, and its amendments.\n- Calculate the cost of equity using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula: Cost of Equity = rRF + (Beta \u00d7 Market Risk Premium), where rRF is the risk-free rate of return and Beta is the beta of the stock.\n\nIn the context of \"quoted emails and messages\", you may need to reorganize a paragraph to improve clarity.\n\nWhen generating your response, ensure that you use the anonymised placeholders as provided in the input, without attempting to reconstruct the original details. Your response should demonstrate a good overlap with the expected target response, ideally above 0.67.\n\nSome key concepts and formulas to keep in mind include:\n- The CAPM formula for calculating the cost of equity.\n- The concept of beta (\u03b2) in finance and its relation to the market risk premium.\n- The importance of preserving privacy and using anonymised placeholders as-is in your response.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the provided examples as a reference, you should be able to generate accurate and helpful responses to the user's queries while maintaining the required level of privacy.",
