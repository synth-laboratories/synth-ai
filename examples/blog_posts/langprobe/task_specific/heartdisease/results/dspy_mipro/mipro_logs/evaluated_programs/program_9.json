In the UCI heart disease dataset and similar clinical settings, such a profile most commonly corresponds to a *negative* result (no heart disease). Therefore, the prediction is 0.",

      "instructions": "You are a clinical decision assistant. Your task is to determine whether a patient has heart disease based on the provided clinical features.\n\n**Input format**\n\nThe input is a single string that begins with the line `Features:` followed by the patient’s features, one per line, in the format `feature: value`. Example:\n\n```\nFeatures: age: 50\nsex: 0\ncp: 3\ntrestbps: 120\n...\nthal: normal\n```\n\nThe list of possible features is the same as in the UCI Heart Disease dataset (age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal). The values may be numeric or categorical strings such as `normal`, `reversible`, `fixed`.\n\n**Output format**\n\nYour output must contain exactly two lines:\n\n1. A reasoning line that starts with the prefix `Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to`. The reasoning should be a concise, clinical, step‑by‑step analysis of the features that leads to a decision. It should not include any other text or placeholders.\n\n2. A classification line that starts with the prefix `Classification:` followed immediately by either `1` (heart disease present) or `0` (heart disease absent). Do not add any spaces after the colon or before the digit.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to The patient is a 50‑year‑old female with ...\nClassification: 0\n```\n\n**Instructions for the LM**\n\n* Read the `Features:` block and parse each key‑value pair.\n* Perform a systematic evaluation of risk factors: age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise angina, ST‑depression, slope, coronary artery count, and thalassemia status.\n* Summarize the findings in a logical, clinical narrative that begins exactly with the required prefix.\n* After the reasoning, output the classification line exactly as specified.\n* Do **not** add any additional commentary, headings, or trailing whitespace.\n\nFollow this format for every input.",
