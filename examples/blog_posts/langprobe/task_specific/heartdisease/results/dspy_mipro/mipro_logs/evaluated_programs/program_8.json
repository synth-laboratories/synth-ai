        "reasoning": "The patient is relatively young (41 yr) and female (sex = 0), both of which reduce heart‑disease risk. Blood pressure (130 mm Hg) and cholesterol (204 mg/dL) are within acceptable ranges, and fasting blood sugar is normal. The key warning signs would be an elevated resting ECG abnormality (restecg = 2) and a modest ST‑segment depression (oldpeak = 1.4). However, the absence of angina on exertion (exang = 0), the lack of any coronary artery lesions (ca = 0), a normal thalassemia status, and a high maximum heart rate (thalach = 172) all point toward a low probability of clinical heart disease. Based on typical clinical decision thresholds and the patterns observed in the UCI Heart Disease dataset, the overall assessment favors a negative prediction for heart disease.",

        "reasoning": "The patient is a 48‑year‑old male with several risk factors that are not strongly predictive of heart disease. The key points are:\n\n| Feature | Value | Typical effect on risk |\n|---------|-------|------------------------|\n| Age | 48 | Below the age threshold (~55) → lower risk |\n| Sex | Male | Slightly higher risk |\n| Chest‑pain type | 2 (non‑anginal) | Mild to moderate |\n| Resting BP | 110 | Normal |\n| Cholesterol | 229 | Mildly elevated |\n| Resting ECG | 0 (normal) | Low risk |\n| Max heart rate | 168 | Slightly high but not definitive |\n| Exercise angina | 0 | Low risk |\n| ST‑depression (oldpeak) | 1.0 | Mild |\n| ST‑slope | 3 (downsloping) | Higher risk |\n| Number of major vessels (ca) | 0 | Low risk |\n| Thalassemia status | reversible (abnormal) | Adds some risk |\n\nOverall, the combination of a young age, normal blood pressure, normal ECG, and only mild elevations in cholesterol and ST‑depression keeps the probability of heart disease relatively low. The main risk boosters (male sex, abnormal thal, downsloping ST‑slope) are counterbalanced by the absence of other major factors such as multiple vessel disease or significant exercise angina.  \nGiven these considerations, a prediction of **no heart disease** is more probable than a positive diagnosis.",
