The ST depression during exercise (oldpeak = 0.8) and the slope of the ST segment (slope = 1) are both mild, suggesting no significant ischemic response. Chest pain type 2 (atypical angina) combined with 0 vessels diseased (ca = 0) and normal thalassemia status further reduce the likelihood of significant coronary artery disease.

Her maximum heart rate achieved during exercise (thalach = 172) is high, suggesting good exercise capacity. The patient reports no exercise‑induced angina (exang = 0) and the ECG shows a non‑specific abnormality (restecg = 2), which is a weaker risk factor. The ST‑segment depression (oldpeak = 1.4 mm) is moderate and the slope of the rise (slope = 1, upsloping) is not the most concerning pattern. The number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is zero (ca = 0) and the thalassemia result is normal. Overall, the combination of a relatively young age, female sex, lack of additional high‑risk clinical findings, and a fairly favorable exercise tolerance points toward a low probability of clinically significant heart disease.
