            "- The world contains trees (wood), stone, coal, iron, plants, cows, zombies, and water.\n"
            "- Movement constraints: you cannot walk onto blocking tiles: tree, stone, water, lava, coal, iron. Navigate around obstacles.\n"
            "- You start with empty hands and low health/hunger.\n"
            "- Interact ('do') only when adjacent to a resource (tree, stone, cow, zombie, etc.).\n"
            "- Movement is essential: you can and should move multiple steps in one turn to explore effectively.\n"
            "- Achievements are unlocked by collecting resources, crafting tools, placing objects, fighting, and surviving longer.\n\n"

            "2. Craft a wood pickaxe as soon as you have enough wood ('make_wood_pickaxe').\n"
            "3. Use the pickaxe to gather stone, then craft a stone pickaxe. Progress to iron tools as you find iron.\n"
            "4. Build a table ('place_table') to unlock more crafting options (furnace, sword, etc.).\n"
            "5. Manage hunger by collecting and eating plants or interacting with cows.\n"
            "6. Fight zombies with a sword for achievements and resources.\n"
            "7. Survive by balancing exploration, combat, and resource gathering.\n\n"
            "8. Keep moving to discover new resources and stay alive. If you're in the middle of nowhere, take 5-8 consecutive move-related actions to explore and see what's outside your field of view. Don't delay exploration when it's the right move.\n\n"
