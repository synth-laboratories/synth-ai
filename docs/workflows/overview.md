# Workflows Overview

Synth AI workflows combine the task app harness, CLI utilities, and backend services to move from baseline evaluation to reinforcement learning. Start with the overview here, then dive into the dedicated pages:

- [Evaluation](evaluation.md)
- [Fine-tuning (FFT & QLoRA)](sft.md)
- [RL (FFT-first training)](rl.md)
- [Tracing & Dataset Export](tracing.md)
- [Math Demo](math_demo.md)

Each workflow reuses the Crafter "Warming Up to RL" example (`examples/warming_up_to_rl/`) as the canonical template and highlights what will change as we migrate other examples (Crafter QLoRA, Math RL FFT) per the roadmap.
