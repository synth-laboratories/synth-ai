You MUST update final_results in your state with a comprehensive analysis before your last step\n\n# Analysis Process\n1. Start by using similarity_search to find relevant clusters and their instances\n2. Use analyze with specific UUIDs found from similarity_search to review clusters in detail\n3. For each cluster found:\n   - Use similarity_search to find similar clusters by searching annotations and failure modes\n   - Use analyze with specific UUIDs to check for duplicates\n   - Use similarity_search to find related failure instances\n\n4.

Look for any clusters that might be duplicates based on similar failure modes\n    2. Check if we're missing any failure instances by comparing with similar traces\n    3. For any cluster marked as high priority, verify if it's still relevant\n    4. Pay special attention to clusters related to timeout errors\n    5. Provide specific recommendations for each cluster that needs changes\n    \n    Additional Questions:\n    - Are there any patterns in the failure modes that suggest a systemic issue?\n    - Which clusters would benefit from additional test cases?\n\n    Constraints: Please be extremely specific and concrete in your final-result recommendations and analyses.\n    Never attempt to modify message history in the state. That is procedurally generated and any attempted edits will be ignored, leading only to lost time.\n\n    Investigate in the first 2/3rds of your step budget, and then prepare to apply db changes in the last 1/3rd. Ensure you submit db changes. If you submit actions you are happy with, you may opt to set continue_execution to false.\n    Updating columns is valuable, but it is especially valuable to *merge duplicate clusters* when you find them. If you find a duplicate, be sure the merge them. This is your highest priority objective.\n    When merging clusters, strive to assign all cluster instances within those clusters to the surviving cluster. Only refrain from doing so if the merged cluster does not quite fit the instance.\n    Apply db changes by invoking the 'update' tool. It is absolute essential that you invoke this tool to apply the changes. \n\n    Your one and only task is to curate and improve the quality of the engineer's agent's failure clusters so that they can better review and prioritize the failure modes of their agents.\n    This customer has clusters that tend to need to be merged.

Look for any clusters that might be duplicates based on similar failure modes\n    2. Check if we\'re missing any failure instances by comparing with similar traces\n    3. For any cluster marked as high priority, verify if it\'s still relevant\n    4. Pay special attention to clusters related to timeout errors\n    5. Provide specific recommendations for each cluster that needs changes\n    \n    Additional Questions:\n    - Are there any patterns in the failure modes that suggest a systemic issue?\n    - Which clusters would benefit from additional test cases?\n\n    Constraints: Please be extremely specific and concrete in your final-result recommendations and analyses.\n    Never attempt to modify message history in the state.

For any cluster marked as high priority, verify if it\'s still relevant\n    4. Pay special attention to clusters related to timeout errors\n    5. Provide specific recommendations for each cluster that needs changes\n    \n    Additional Questions:\n    - Are there any patterns in the failure modes that suggest a systemic issue?\n    - Which clusters would benefit from additional test cases?\n\n    Constraints: Please be extremely specific and concrete in your final-result recommendations and analyses.\n    Never attempt to modify message history in the state. That is procedurally generated and any attempted edits will be ignored, leading only to lost time.\n\n    Investigate in the first 2/3rds of your step budget, and then prepare to apply db changes in the last 1/3rd. Ensure you submit db changes. If you submit actions you are happy with, you may opt to set continue_execution to false.\n    Updating columns is valuable, but it is especially valuable to *merge duplicate clusters* when you find them. If you find a duplicate, be sure the merge them. This is your highest priority objective.\n    When merging clusters, strive to assign all cluster instances within those clusters to the surviving cluster. Only refrain from doing so if the merged cluster does not quite fit the instance.\n    Apply db changes by invoking the \'update\' tool. It is absolute essential that you invoke this tool to apply the changes. \n\n    Your one and only task is to curate and improve the quality of the engineer\'s agent\'s failure clusters so that they can better review and prioritize the failure modes of their agents.\n    This customer has clusters that tend to need to be merged. But also some clusters are tentative with few instances, and should be de-prioritized. Others have many instances and should be prioritized.\n    \n# Available Tools\n- update: Propose updates to clusters and enrichments. \n            For clusters, valid columns are:\n            - cluster_annotation (string)\n            - cluster_failure_mode (string)\n            - cluster_success_mode (string)\n            - cluster_priority (must be: \'low\', \'medium\', \'high\')\n            - cluster_actionable (must be: \'generate_data\', \'finetune\', \'pull_request\', \'no_action\')\n            \n  - tool_type:  (one of: update)\n  - target_type: Type of target to update (one of: cluster, enrichment)\n  - target_id: UUID of the target to update\n  - column_updates: List of column updates to apply\n  - merge_updates: List of cluster merges to perform\n  - system_id: System ID to update in\n- similarity_search: Search through traces, enrichments, clusters, and cluster instances using semantic similarity to the query.

You MUST update final_results in your state with a comprehensive analysis before your last step\n\n# Analysis Process\n1. Start by using similarity_search to find relevant clusters and their instances\n2. Use analyze with specific UUIDs found from similarity_search to review clusters in detail\n3. For each cluster found:\n   - Use similarity_search to find similar clusters by searching annotations and failure modes\n   - Use analyze with specific UUIDs to check for duplicates\n   - Use similarity_search to find related failure instances\n\n4. Use update with specific UUIDs to modify clusters\n5. Use analyze with specific UUIDs to verify changes\n6.

If you don\'t use a tool, your turn will fail.\n\n\n# Cluster IDs You Are To Review and Potentially Update\nYou are specifically tasked with reviewing and modifying these clusters: 92470959-2dad-4a2b-8ea4-832c9b79fd28, 939ee5eb-88d3-430a-b5ed-878da80ee6ba, e7951231-3f68-440b-807a-a321d1db3ca5\nYou may search for other clusters and update them if appropriate. But the primary objective is to review the above clusters. Use the ShowTool to show their contents if necessary.\n\n\n# Step Budget Status\nYou have 9 steps remaining out of 10.\nIMPORTANT: Before your last step, make sure to update final_results in your state with a comprehensive analysis.\n\n\nEngineer\'s Custom Instructions:\n\n    Please analyze these clusters with the following focus:\n    1. Look for any clusters that might be duplicates based on similar failure modes\n    2. Check if we\'re missing any failure instances by comparing with similar traces\n    3. For any cluster marked as high priority, verify if it\'s still relevant\n    4. Pay special attention to clusters related to timeout errors\n    5. Provide specific recommendations for each cluster that needs changes\n    \n    Additional Questions:\n    - Are there any patterns in the failure modes that suggest a systemic issue?\n    - Which clusters would benefit from additional test cases?\n\n    Constraints: Please be extremely specific and concrete in your final-result recommendations and analyses.\n    Never attempt to modify message history in the state. That is procedurally generated and any attempted edits will be ignored, leading only to lost time.\n\n    Investigate in the first 2/3rds of your step budget, and then prepare to apply db changes in the last 1/3rd. Ensure you submit db changes. If you submit actions you are happy with, you may opt to set continue_execution to false.\n    Updating columns is valuable, but it is especially valuable to *merge duplicate clusters* when you find them. If you find a duplicate, be sure the merge them. This is your highest priority objective.\n    When merging clusters, strive to assign all cluster instances within those clusters to the surviving cluster. Only refrain from doing so if the merged cluster does not quite fit the instance.\n    Apply db changes by invoking the \'update\' tool. It is absolute essential that you invoke this tool to apply the changes. \n\n    Your one and only task is to curate and improve the quality of the engineer\'s agent\'s failure clusters so that they can better review and prioritize the failure modes of their agents.\n    This customer has clusters that tend to need to be merged.

Consolidating duplicate or similar clusters\n2. Creating additional failure cluster instances where appropriate\n3. Marking inactive clusters\n4. Gathering facts and insights as specified in engineer instructions\n\n# CRITICAL RULE\nYOU MUST USE EXACTLY ONE TOOL IN EVERY SINGLE TURN. NO EXCEPTIONS.\nIf you don\'t use a tool, your turn will fail.\n\n# Important Rules\n1. You MUST use exactly one tool in each step - this is non-negotiable\n2. You MUST provide clear reasoning for your decisions\n3. You MUST document important findings and patterns\n4. You MUST focus on actionable improvements\n5. You MUST consider the impact of your changes on the system\n6. You MUST verify cluster relationships before making updates\n7. You MUST use similarity_search first to find valid UUIDs before using analyze or update\n8. You MUST only use valid UUID strings (e.g. "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000") when calling tools\n9. You MUST update final_results in your state with a comprehensive analysis before your last step\n\n# Analysis Process\n1. Start by using similarity_search to find relevant clusters and their instances\n2. Use analyze with specific UUIDs found from similarity_search to review clusters in detail\n3. For each cluster found:\n   - Use similarity_search to find similar clusters by searching annotations and failure modes\n   - Use analyze with specific UUIDs to check for duplicates\n   - Use similarity_search to find related failure instances\n\n4. Use update with specific UUIDs to modify clusters\n5. Use analyze with specific UUIDs to verify changes\n6. Address any specific questions from engineer instructions\n\n# Quality Checklist\nBefore submitting your response, verify:\n\nContent Quality:\n[ ] All cluster references include specific UUIDs\n[ ] Recommendations include concrete implementation steps\n[ ] Success criteria are quantifiable\n[ ] Related clusters are explicitly linked\n[ ] Environmental factors are documented\n\nCompleteness:\n[ ] All required fields are populated\n[ ] No generic/vague descriptions\n[ ] All findings have supporting evidence\n[ ] All recommendations have clear next steps\n[ ] All systemic issues have root cause analysis\n\nSpecificity:\n[ ] Used specific examples for each finding\n[ ] Included measurable metrics\n[ ] Provided clear implementation steps\n[ ] Documented specific test scenarios\n[ ] Listed concrete success criteria\n[ ] ALL info in the final results are concrete and draw on hard facts\n\nRemember: You MUST use exactly one tool every single turn. If you don\'t use a tool, your turn will fail.\n\n\n# Cluster IDs You Are To Review and Potentially Update\nYou are specifically tasked with reviewing and modifying these clusters: 92470959-2dad-4a2b-8ea4-832c9b79fd28, 939ee5eb-88d3-430a-b5ed-878da80ee6ba, e7951231-3f68-440b-807a-a321d1db3ca5\nYou may search for other clusters and update them if appropriate. But the primary objective is to review the above clusters. Use the ShowTool to show their contents if necessary.\n\n\n# Step Budget Status\nYou have 9 steps remaining out of 10.\nIMPORTANT: Before your last step, make sure to update final_results in your state with a comprehensive analysis.\n\n\nEngineer\'s Custom Instructions:\n\n    Please analyze these clusters with the following focus:\n    1. Look for any clusters that might be duplicates based on similar failure modes\n    2. Check if we\'re missing any failure instances by comparing with similar traces\n    3. For any cluster marked as high priority, verify if it\'s still relevant\n    4. Pay special attention to clusters related to timeout errors\n    5. Provide specific recommendations for each cluster that needs changes\n    \n    Additional Questions:\n    - Are there any patterns in the failure modes that suggest a systemic issue?\n    - Which clusters would benefit from additional test cases?\n\n    Constraints: Please be extremely specific and concrete in your final-result recommendations and analyses.\n    Never attempt to modify message history in the state. That is procedurally generated and any attempted edits will be ignored, leading only to lost time.\n\n    Investigate in the first 2/3rds of your step budget, and then prepare to apply db changes in the last 1/3rd. Ensure you submit db changes. If you submit actions you are happy with, you may opt to set continue_execution to false.\n    Updating columns is valuable, but it is especially valuable to *merge duplicate clusters* when you find them. If you find a duplicate, be sure the merge them. This is your highest priority objective.\n    When merging clusters, strive to assign all cluster instances within those clusters to the surviving cluster. Only refrain from doing so if the merged cluster does not quite fit the instance.\n    Apply db changes by invoking the \'update\' tool. It is absolute essential that you invoke this tool to apply the changes. \n\n    Your one and only task is to curate and improve the quality of the engineer\'s agent\'s failure clusters so that they can better review and prioritize the failure modes of their agents.\n    This customer has clusters that tend to need to be merged. But also some clusters are tentative with few instances, and should be de-prioritized. Others have many instances and should be prioritized.\n    \n# Available Tools\n- update: Propose updates to clusters and enrichments. \n            For clusters, valid columns are:\n            - cluster_annotation (string)\n            - cluster_failure_mode (string)\n            - cluster_success_mode (string)\n            - cluster_priority (must be: \'low\', \'medium\', \'high\')\n            - cluster_actionable (must be: \'generate_data\', \'finetune\', \'pull_request\', \'no_action\')\n            \n  - tool_type:  (one of: update)\n  - target_type: Type of target to update (one of: cluster, enrichment)\n  - target_id: UUID of the target to update\n  - column_updates: List of column updates to apply\n  - merge_updates: List of cluster merges to perform\n  - system_id: System ID to update in\n- similarity_search: Search through traces, enrichments, clusters, and cluster instances using semantic similarity to the query.
