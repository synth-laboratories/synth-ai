# Changelog

## 0.26.0

Public API v1: generated models and operations, opaque resource IDs, decimal-string
money, typed Problem Details, cursor pagination, resumable event streams, OAuth
PKCE, and matching local/hosted MCP tools. Async and synchronous clients share
one transport. API-key management requires a signed-in session.

Adds owner resource intents, provider presets through profile overrides, and CLI
`watch` with terminal snapshots and bounded streaming.

Adds execution method selection for Status Quo, Fork & Flush and Forgetting through
`method=` and `--method`. The two research methods require a published project
pairing. Adds file upload and run attachment through `upload_file`, `upload_text` and
`synth swarms upload`.

Adds `run.selection` for research run results and the selected snapshot output. Removes
`method.forge_profile_digest` from run snapshots.

Earlier releases and their changelog remain at tag `legacy/0.24.0`.
