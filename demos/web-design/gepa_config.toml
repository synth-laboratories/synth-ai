VISUAL STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Use a clean, modern, minimalist design aesthetic
- Color Scheme: Light backgrounds with high contrast dark text
- Typography: Large, bold headings with clear hierarchy
- Layout: Spacious with generous padding and margins
- Branding: Professional, tech-forward visual identity

Create a webpage that feels polished, modern, and trustworthy."""
