It's tempting to get that sale and run 100% towards it which is the approach we took, but a 'safer' one is probably to make multiple sales before building. People who tried to build in this space and failed advised us to do exactly this. If you can do this you've likely uncovered the makings of a massive company.

No one (apart from one ex-Intercom founder) really cared about experimenting with pricing as a lever to drive more revenue. Standard practice was just looking at competition and charging a market rate.\n    *   Pain Points with Stripe:\n        *   Managing credit-based billing systems. There is no good tool out there for this today.\n        *   Chasing up invoices that haven't been paid. AI seems like a no-brainer here, but definitely a bunch of solutions already.\n        *   Revenue recognition from Stripe. Usually around Series A there needs to be a big clean up for investors. People don't enter the right contract terms in Stripe when they're first starting out which leads to messy data.\n        *   Maintaining a billing system and making pricing changes. Especially if supporting multiple versions (grandfathering) and moving people between plans.\n        *   Dealing with custom contracts for sales-led and product-led teams. Stripe doesn't seem to have great tooling for this, creating free trials etc.\n        *   People had tried third-party billing software but dropped them when they couldn't support a specific nuance of their pricing model (eg dealing with upgrade / downgrade pro rata meters differently)\n    *   TLDR: we're going to keep going and are excited.\n",

It links issues to Merge Requests so that issues update automatically from In Progress to Done as the MR moves from drafted to merged - there is no need to update the issue in Linear at all. Move even faster by using a keyboard shortcut that creates the issue's git branch name, assigns the issue and moves the issue to In Progress in one step.\n    *   How it works Text: Configure the GitLab integration in a couple of minutes by authenticating and selecting which repos to connect to Linear. Once you do, anyone in the workspace can start linking MRs. Link MRs to issues in a few ways. Use the issue ID in the branch name or MR title before creating the MR. To link multiple MRs, or link issues after creating the MR, use magic words along with the issue ID in the MR description. This will create a link to the MR in the Linear issue and a linkback to Linear from the MR. Set workflow automations on a per team basis so that issues move through different issue statuses based on MR status. Turn on a couple of account preferences settings to enable personal GitLab automations that auto-assign issues and move them to In Progress.\n    *   Configure Text: Go to settings and follow the prompts to set up the integration (it takes a few steps and requires a webhook). Follow advanced instructions to set up self-hosted installations. A Linear admin with sufficient GitLab permissions can enable this integration for the full workspace.\n    *   Related Integrations Titles: GitHub, VS Code, Figma and descriptions for each.\n    *   Build your own integration Text: Create your own integration with Linear's API and submit it to the directory.\n    *   Footer lists of links under Features, Product, Company, Resources, and Connect.\n",

The Render platform is designed from the ground up to support multi-service architectures. You can assemble different service types into any combination you need, using any set of languages and frameworks.\"\n    *   Example Scenario: \"A common multi-service web app might consist of: A React or Next.js website for the app's frontend; An Express or Django API server to handle requests from clients; A relational database for long-term storage of application data.\"\n    *   Prerequisites: \"Before we start deploying, confirm all of the following: 1. You've created your Render account. 2. Each project you want to deploy is one of the following: A repository hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; A Docker image in a supported registry, such as Docker Hub. 3. Your full application works as expected on your local machine. 4. You've consulted your chosen framework's documentation for specific deployment guidance.\"\n    *   Steps to Deploy Introduction: \"In the steps below, we'll first deploy each component of our architecture. Then, we'll connect them by setting environment variables.\"\n    *   Consider infrastructure as code (laC): \"As your architecture grows in scale, it becomes more and more helpful to manage your services in a unified way. Render Blueprints enable you to configure and update the entire architecture of your app with a single YAML file.\"\n",

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating on GitHub through public issues and pull requests, as well as in our PostHog User and internal Slack.\"\n    *   Our communication values list:\n        1.  Assume positive intent. Always coming from a position of positivity and grace.\n        2.  Form an opinion. We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.\n        3.  Feedback is essential. Help everyone up their game in a direct but constructive way.\n    *   Golden rules list:\n        1.  Use asynchronous communication when possible: pull requests (preferred) or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate Slack channels and people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat.\n        2.  Discussion in GitHub issues or pull requests is preferred over everything else. If you need a response urgently, you can Slack someone with a link to your comment on an issue or pull request, asking them to respond there. However, be aware that they still may not see it straight away (and that's OK in our book). That said, casual conversations in Slack are completely normal - it's our main space for day-to-day communication.\n        3.  You are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.\n        4.  It is 100% OK to ask as many questions as you have - please ask in public channels! If someone sends you a handbook link, that means they are proud that we have the answer documented - they don't mean that you should have found that yourself or that this is the.\n    *   Cookie banner text: \"PostHog.com doesn't use third-party cookies, only a single in-house cookie.

It mentions support for various SDKs (TypeScript, Rust, Python) and the benefits of SQLite for data portability, versionability, and queryability. It also describes AgentFS as a standardized SQLite schema and its integration with existing agent frameworks, introducing the concept of using a POSIX filesystem via an `agentfs mount` command.\n\n*   **Why FUSE? Section:**\n    *   Heading: \"Why FUSE?\".\n    *   Body text outlining the advantages of a POSIX filesystem, such as universal tool compatibility and ease of integration, contrasted with SDK dependencies. It highlights its usefulness for AI coding agents and integration with standard Unix tools like `git`. The section also details observability benefits, allowing users to monitor agent activity using tools like `ls`, `cat`, `tail`, `find`, `grep`, and `diff`.\n\n*   **Example: Using AgentFS with Claude Code Section:**\n    *   Heading: \"Example: Using AgentFS with Claude Code\".\n    *   Introductory text for installation instructions.\n    *   **Code Block 1:** Command-line instructions for installing `agentfs` via `curl`, including typical installation output.\n    *   Introductory text for initializing an agent filesystem.\n    *   **Code Block 2:** Command-line instructions for `agentfs init demo` with output confirming filesystem creation.\n    *   Introductory text for mounting the filesystem.\n    *   **Code Block 3:** Command-line instructions for `mkdir` and `agentfs mount` to establish the filesystem at a specified path.\n    *   Introductory text for cloning a Git repository.\n    *   **Code Block 4:** Command-line instructions for `cd` and `git clone` with detailed output of the cloning process and timing metrics.\n    *   Introductory text for interacting with Claude Code.\n    *   **Code Block 5:** A multi-line interactive dialogue, simulating an interaction with \"Claude Code V2.0.50\". It displays initial information (tips, welcome message, recent activity), current context (`Opus 4.5`, filesystem path), and a prompt to update `README.md` to mention FUSE support. It then shows the output of reading `README.md` and a subsequent update summary, listing AgentFS components (SDK, CLI, Specification, Sandbox, FUSE).\n    *   A set of interactive choices following Code Block 5: \"1. Yes\", \"2. Yes, allow all edits during this session (shift+tab)\", \"3. Type here to tell Claude what to do differently\".\n    *   Introductory text explaining continued use with Git.\n    *   **Code Block 6:** A `git diff` command with output showcasing changes made to `README.md`, specifically an update to the listed number of AgentFS components and the addition of FUSE.\n    *   Contextual links to a \"blog post\" and \"Getting Started\".\n    *   Introductory text for unmounting the filesystem.\n    *   **Code Block 7:** Command-line instruction for `umount agents/demo`.\n    *   Introductory text for inspecting the filesystem post-unmount.\n    *   **Code Block 8:** Command-line instruction for `agentfs fs ls demo | head` with output listing directories and files within the unmounted agent filesystem.\n    *   Introductory text for direct SQLite database querying.\n    *   **Code Block 9:** SQLite command-line interaction demonstrating direct querying of the `agentfs/demo.db` file, including version, schema, and a `SELECT` statement displaying filesystem entries.\n\n*   **How It Works Section:**\n    *   Heading: \"How It Works\".\n    *   Body text explaining FUSE as a Linux kernel subsystem that mediates between the Virtual Filesystem (VFS) and a userspace filesystem. It details how AgentFS FUSE support utilizes the `fuser` Rust crate and how the AgentFS userspace process communicates with the Linux kernel via FUSE.\n    *   **Diagram:** A conceptual diagram illustrating the architecture. It distinguishes between \"Userspace\" components (Agent, AgentFS SDK, Turso/SQLite, AgentFS process) and \"Linux kernel\" components (VFS, FUSE), showing the communication flow between them.\n    *   A caption associated with the diagram: \"Figure 1: Architecture diagram of AgentFS FUSE module. Agent in userspace interacts with the Linux kernel, which delegates virtual filesystem operations to an AgentFS process via the FUSE module in the kernel. The AgentFS process embeds a Turso database library accessing a SQLite database file that hosts the agent filesystem using the AgentFS SDK.\"\n    *   Further body text elaborating on kernel-crossing interactions, asynchronous write-back mechanisms, and the characteristics of the SQLite database file, including its durability, queryability, snapshotability, and support for full POSIX filesystem semantics.\n\n*   **Summary Section:**\n    *   Heading: \"Summary\".\n    *   Body text summarizing the core benefit of AgentFS FUSE support: bridging the gap between AgentFS SDKs and native filesystem tools. It reiterates advantages such as portability, queryability, auditability, real-time observability, and snapshotting, enabling agents to leverage standard Unix tools with a SQLite-backed filesystem. It concludes by highlighting the flexibility this offers for developers.\n\n*   **Article Conclusion:**\n    *   A final call to action with text: \"To try out FUSE support, grab the `agentfs` CLI from GitHub and run `agentfs mount` to get started.\" The word \"GitHub\" functions as a link.\n\n*   **Article Sharing Section:**\n    *   A label \"Share article\".\n    *   A set of interactive elements (icons/links) to share the article on various social platforms (X, LinkedIn) and to copy the article's URL.\n\n*   **Footer:**\n    *   A copyright notice \"\u00a9 Turso 2023\".\n    *   A set of social media and community links (RSS, YouTube, Discord/Slack, GitHub, LinkedIn).\n    *   Three thematic lists of links:\n        *   \"Turso Cloud\": Quickstart, Documentation, Pricing, API Status, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.\n        *   \"Turso Database\": Embedded Replicas, Database Branching, Backups & Recovery, Platform API.\n        *   \"Company\": About, Contact Us, Support, Trust, Blog.\n\n**3.

    "functional_description": "1. Page Overview:\nDocumentation page explaining Persistent Disks functionality within the Render platform. It describes how persistent disks work, their use cases, how to set them up, monitor their usage, and transfer files.\n\n2. Sections:\n   - Title: \"Persistent Disks\"\n   - Introduction: Explains that persistent disks preserve filesystem changes across deploys and restarts and that they can be attached to a paid Render service (web service, private service, or background worker). Includes a notice stating that Render services have an ephemeral filesystem by default, meaning any changes made without a persistent disk are lost on redeploy or restart.\n   - Use Cases: Lists examples of services for which persistent disks are useful (infrastructure components, blogging platforms, collaboration apps, custom datastores) and a note about Render-managed Postgres and Key Value instances.\n   - Disk Properties: Mentions that persistent disks use the same high-performance SSDs as Render Postgres and Key Value Instances and that all disks are encrypted with automatic daily snapshots.\n   - Setup: Explains the process of setting up a persistent disk, including a note to understand limitations and considerations. States that persistent disks can be created from the Render Dashboard during service creation or from the service's Disks page.\n   - Disk Configuration: Shows a form to configure a disk with the following input fields: \"Mount path\" (with an example) and a set of selectable sizes (1 GB, 5 GB, 10 GB, 50 GB, 100 GB).\n   - Setup Steps: Describes the steps involved in setting up the disk, including: setting the mount path, choosing a disk size, and clicking the \"Add disk\" button.\n   - Monitoring Usage: States that you can view disk usage over time from the service's Disks page. Shows a graph of disk usage over time, with labels for disk usage amount and time.\n   - Disk Snapshots: Explains that Render automatically creates a snapshot of the persistent disk once every 24 hours. Includes an \"Important\" notice with the following information: that restoring a snapshot results in data loss of any changes after the snapshot, that Render does not support partial snapshot restoration, and that snapshots used for custom databases should not be restored for database recovery purposes.\n   - Snapshot Restoration: Explains that you can restore a snapshot from the service's Disks page. Shows a list of snapshots with dates and times, each with a \"Restore\" button.\n   - Restoring a Custom Database: Explains that disk restores should not be used for database recovery if the persistent disk is used for backing a custom database instance. Suggests using database-specific tools like mysqldump or mongodump for backup and restoration.\n   - Transferring Files: Introduces methods for securely transferring files between a disk-backed service and a local machine. Mentions SCP and Magic-Wormhole.\n   - SCP: Explains how to transfer files using SCP after setting up SSH for the service. Includes example ssh and scp commands. Recommends using SCP with a specific flag for the SFTP protocol.\n   - Magic-Wormhole: Explains how to transfer files using Magic-Wormhole library. States to visit the Shell page in Render Dashboard to use Magic-Wormhole. States to install Magic-Wormhole using the shell, if Docker is used. Includes an example wormhole command.\n   - Disk Limitations and Considerations: Provides a list of considerations and limitations when attaching a persistent disk. This includes information on data preservation, access restrictions, scaling limitations, downtime during redeploys, and restrictions on adding disks to cron jobs.\n\n3. Interactive Elements:\n   - Link to Render Dashboard (multiple instances): Navigates to the Render Dashboard.\n   - Button: \"Add disk\" - Adds a persistent disk with the configured settings.\n   - Button: \"Restore\" (for each snapshot) - Restores the disk to the selected snapshot.\n   - Selectable Disk Sizes: 1 GB, 5 GB, 10 GB, 50 GB, 100 GB - Chooses the size of the persistent disk.\n   - Link to \"Disks page\": Navigates to the service's Disks page in the Render Dashboard.\n   - Link to \"Shell page\": Navigates to the service's Shell page in the Render Dashboard.\n   - Link to \"See details\": Provides additional information about database restore.\n\n4. Content Details:\n   - Heading: Persistent Disks\n   - Body Text: Explanatory text about persistent disks, their use cases, limitations, and setup instructions.\n   - Labels: Mount path, Size, Disk Usage, Across all instances\n   - Example Mount Path: /var/data\n   - Code snippets: Example ssh, scp, and wormhole commands.\n   - Disclaimer Text: Information about ephemeral filesystems, data loss, and database restoration.\n   - Notice text: \"By default, Render services have an ephemeral filesystem.\"\n",

Automatic failover handles scenarios where your primary instance becomes unavailable.\"\n   *   Manual Failover Triggering: \"You can manually trigger a failover to your database's standby instance from the Render Dashboard. You might want to do this to test out reconnection behavior for your apps, or to demonstrate failover capabilities for compliance purposes. Go to your database's Info page and click Trigger Fallover under the High Availability section:\"\n   *   Manual Failover Data Loss: \"Performing a manual failover with a healthy primary instance almost never causes any loss of data.

In the unlikely event that both nodes are affected by an incident, your database will experience downtime.\"\n        *   \"When an automatic failover occurs, a small number of the most recent writes to your degraded primary instance might not be represented in your standby instance. These changes are lost.\"\n        *   \"This is because data is replicated asynchronously, and the primary might not have pushed the most recent writes to the standby before the degradation occurred.\"\n        *   \"A manual failover almost never results in lost changes, but it's possible that changes to your primary instance in the last few seconds before the failover will be lost.\"\n        *   \"Failover isn't possible if your standby instance isn't available. This might occur for one of the following reasons: The standby is affected by the same severe incident as the primary, The standby is affected by an unrelated, simultaneous incident, Render is performing routine maintenance on the standby, An incident occurs shortly after a previous failover occurred, and the degraded instance has not yet become healthy, An incident occurs shortly after you initialize your primary database (before the standby is also initialized).\"\n        *   \"You can't connect to a HA database's standby instance or use it for query scaling purposes.

Unlike procedures, a kernel is called (\\\"launched\\\") once and returns once, but is executed many times, once each by a number of threads. These executions are generally concurrent (their execution order is non-deterministic) and parallel (they occur simultaneously on different execution units). The collection of all threads executing a kernel is organized as a kernel grid - aka a thread block grid, the highest level of the CUDA programming model's thread hierarchy. A kernel grid executes across multiple Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and so operates at the scale of the entire GPU. The matching level of the memory hierarchy is the global memory. In CUDA C++, kernels are passed pointers to global memory on the device when they are invoked by the host and return nothing -- they just mutate memory. To give a flavor for CUDA kernel programming, let's walk through two implementations of the \\\"hello world\\\" of CUDA kernels: matrix multiplication of two square matrices, A and B. The two implementations will differ in how they map the textbook matrix multiplication algorithm onto the thread hierarchy and memory hierarchy. In the simplest implementation, inspired by the first matmul kernel in Programming Massively Parallel Processors \u2197 (4th edition, Figure 3.11), each thread does all of the work to compute one element of the output matrix -- loading in turn each element of a particular row of A and a particular column of B into registers, multiplying the paired elements, summing the results, and placing the sum back in global memory.\"",

This provides excellent performance for OLTP workloads but limits certain PostgreSQL features that require persistent connections. Learn more at the PgBouncer documentation.\"\n    *   \"For use cases that require long-running operations, direct connections on port 5432 are recommended. For example:\"\n    *   The code snippet in \"Local PgBouncer\" starts with \"psql 'host=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-1.psdb.cloud port=5432 user=...'\"\n    *   \"The local PgBouncer does not support running queries to replicas; all connections through the local PgBouncer are automatically routed to the primary database, regardless of the username specification. Use a dedicated replica PgBouncer for replica access.\"\n    *   \"Dedicated replica PgBouncers can be created to run on nodes separate from the Postgres servers. This is useful for applications that send significant read traffic to replicas and need connection pooling. This offers similar high-availability benefits as the local PgBouncer but is used for read-only replica traffic.\"\n    *   The code snippet in \"Connecting to dedicated replica PgBouncers\" starts with \"psql 'host=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-1.replica.psdb.cloud port=5432 user=user_1234567890@xxxxxxxx'\"\n    *   The code snippet in \"Connecting to dedicated primary PgBouncers\" starts with \"psql 'host=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-1.psdb.cloud port=5432 user=user_1234567890@xxxxxxxx'\"\n    *   The table of basic settings contains parameters such as \"default_pool_size\", \"min_pool_size\", \"max_client_conn\", etc., along with their descriptions and default values.\n    *   The table of advanced settings contains parameters such as \"max_prepared_statements\", \"max_db_connections\", \"query_timeout\", etc., along with their descriptions and default values.\n    *   \"Connection reuse is the key mechanism that makes PgBouncer effective. When a client completes a transaction, PgBouncer returns the server connection to the pool rather than closing it. The next client transaction can immediately reuse that existing connection without incurring the overhead of spawning a new Postgres process.\"\n    *   The list of pooling modes includes \"Session Pooling\", \"Statement Pooling\", and \"Transaction Pooling\".\n    *   \"PgBouncer's transaction pooling mode provides excellent performance for OLTP workloads but limits certain PostgreSQL features that require persistent connections.\"\n    *   \"Using PgBouncer provides improved availability during configuration changes. When modifying Postgres Parameters, some changes require the server to be restarted. When these restarts happen, any direct connections to Postgres will be terminated. However, when using PgBouncer, client connections are maintained and PgBouncer handles reconnecting to Postgres after it restarts.\"\n    *   \"PgBouncer itself is a lightweight process, but high connection counts or high query throughput can overwhelm it's extent to capacity.

By connecting them to live data\u2014whether that\u2019s Google Drive documents, official API docs, Slack messages, or an internal database\u2014MCP helps ensure the model\u2019s answers are up-to-date, context-rich, and domain-specific.\"\n        *   \"Unified data access: Before MCP, a developer might have to juggle separate plugins, tokens, or custom wrappers to give an LLM system access to multiple sources. With MCP, you configure one protocol, then the LLM can \u201csee\u201d all registered connectors; it\u2019s a step toward a more uniform, standardized ecosystem.\"\n        *   \"Long-term maintainability: Ad-hoc solutions become a nightmare as your organization adds more data sources. MCP\u2019s open, standardized approach means less breakage and simpler debugging. Instead of rewriting integrations every time you adopt a new platform, you can rely on (and contribute to) a shared library of MCP servers.\"\n    *   MCP Core Concepts:\n        *   \"Servers: A server in MCP terms is anything that exposes resources or tools to the model. For example, you might build a server that provides a \u201cget_forecast\u201d function (tool) or a \u201c/policies/leave-policy.md\u201d resource (file-like content).\"\n        *   \"Clients: A client is an LLM-based interface or tool (like Claude for Desktop or a code editor like Cursor) that can discover and invoke MCP servers. This is how the user\u2019s text prompts are turned into actual function calls without constantly switching between systems.\"\n        *   \"Tools, resources, prompts:\n            *   Tools: Functions the model can call with user approval (e.g., `createJiraTicket`, `updateDatabaseEntry`).\n            *   Resources: File-like data the model can read, such as `company_wiki.md` or a dataset representing financial records.\n            *   Prompts: Templated text that helps the model perform specialized tasks.\"\n    *   Getting Started:\n        *   \"Official Anthropic documentation: For a step-by-step introduction, see the official Anthropic documentation.\"\n        *   \"MCP quickstarts\"\n        *   \"Open-source connectors: Check out existing servers for Stack, Git, Github, Google Drive, Postgres, and Puppetter.\"\n        *   \"Claude Desktop: A convenient way to see MCP in action.
