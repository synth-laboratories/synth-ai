    "color_palette": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The generated image successfully adopts the reference's dominant palette of deep, desaturated reds, dark browns, and blacks. The vibrant blood red stands out against the muted, dark background, mirroring the contrast and color hierarchy of the original. Overall warmth and saturation levels are very close, creating a consistent dark fantasy aesthetic."
    },
    "brushwork_texture": {
      "score": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "While both images are painterly, the generated image features much smoother blending, finer details, and a cleaner aesthetic characteristic of modern digital painting. It lacks the distinct, visible brush strokes, slightly rougher texture, and grainy quality present in the reference image, which gives the original a more traditional, tactile, and 'gritty' feel. Edges in the generated image are generally sharper."
    },
    "mood_atmosphere": {
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The generated image absolutely nails the moody, gothic, ethereal, and eerie atmosphere of the reference. The dim, dramatic lighting from the lanterns and the glowing swords/blood, combined with deep shadows and oppressive architectural elements, perfectly evoke the desired dark fantasy and surreal horror tone. Both images convey a strong sense of ancient, ritualistic dread."
    },
    "compositional_style": {
      "score": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Both images utilize a strong central focal point (fountain/statue in reference, throne/figure in generated) within a grand, symmetrical architectural space. They both convey a sense of depth through receding elements (figures in the background, rows of pillars) and a dramatic, ceremonial scale. The framing and emphasis on the central structure are highly consistent, leading the eye effectively."
    },
    "overall_score": 0.79,
    "overall_reasoning": "The generated image is a strong match for the 'Blood Crypt' style, particularly excelling in capturing the intended mood, atmosphere, and compositional grandeur. The color palette is also remarkably consistent with the dark, blood-drenched aesthetic of the reference. The primary area where it diverges is the brushwork and texture, which is considerably smoother and more refined/digital compared to the reference's coarser, more traditional painterly strokes. Despite this difference, the overall feeling and core stylistic elements are impressively replicated."
