    "color_palette": {
      "score": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "The reference image uses a predominantly warm, muted, almost sepia-toned palette with golden yellows, desaturated browns, and subtle oranges, giving it an ancient, aged feel. The generated image, in contrast, features a cooler palette with significant blues and desaturated grays in the sky and clouds, contrasting with a vibrant white-yellow central energy and richer autumn orange-brown trees. The overall color temperature, saturation, and contrast levels are distinctly different."
    },
    "brushwork_texture": {
      "score": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "The reference displays a rougher, more visible painterly texture, especially in the cosmic elements and sky, with a distinctive 'grain' or 'dusty' quality and often softer, broken edges. The generated image is also painterly but generally smoother, with more blended clouds and sharper, more defined textures on the rocks and trees. The central cosmic spiral in the generated image is very smooth and clean, lacking the textured speckles prominent in the reference."
    },
    "mood_atmosphere": {
      "score": 0.35,
      "reasoning": "The reference conveys a subdued, ancient, mystical, and subtly unsettling ethereal atmosphere, with its muted tones and textured cosmic events. The generated image, while also ethereal and mystical, projects a more epic, grand, and dramatic mood due to its stronger contrast and cooler palette. It captures the 'powerful magical event' aspect but misses the specific melancholic, aged, and surreal quality described by the artist's style and exemplified by the reference."
    },
    "compositional_style": {
      "score": 0.5,
      "reasoning": "Both images share similar compositional elements: a central figure on a raised platform, surrounded by floating rock-like objects, with a cosmic swirling event in the sky. However, the execution differs. The generated image is much more symmetrical, with a clearly defined circular arrangement of floating monoliths and a perfectly geometric cosmic spiral. The reference, while having a central focus, feels more organic and less rigidly symmetrical, with a less geometrically perfect cosmic swirl and a slightly different perspective."
    },
    "overall_score": 0.325,
    "overall_reasoning": "The generated image successfully interprets the card's theme of 'Harness Infinity' by including a central figure, floating elements, and a cosmic event. However, it largely misses the specific stylistic nuances of the reference artist. Key discrepancies include a significantly different color palette (cooler vs. warmer/sepia), much smoother brushwork and lack of specific textural qualities, and a shift from a subdued, ancient, and surreal mood to a more epic and dramatic one. While the compositional elements are similar, their arrangement and geometric precision in the generated image deviate from the more organic feel of the reference."
