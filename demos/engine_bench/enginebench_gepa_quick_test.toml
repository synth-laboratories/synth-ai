CRITICAL: The stub file contains `todo!()` macros that YOU MUST REPLACE with working code.

Example - if you see:
```rust
pub fn grind_damage(attached_energy: u32) -> i32 { todo!() }
// ATTACK_1_TEXT: "Does 10 damage times the amount of Energy attached"
```

You MUST use the edit tool to change it to:
```rust
pub fn grind_damage(attached_energy: u32) -> i32 { (10 * attached_energy) as i32 }
```

REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
1. Read the stub file ONCE to find the todo!() functions
2. IMMEDIATELY use the edit tool to replace todo!() with working code
3. Run `cargo check` to verify compilation
4. Run `cargo test` to verify tests pass

DO NOT read the file multiple times"""
