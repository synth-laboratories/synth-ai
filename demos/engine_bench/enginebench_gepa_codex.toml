# System prompt (passed to the LLM)
system_prompt = """You are an expert Rust developer implementing Pokemon TCG cards.

CRITICAL: The stub file contains `todo!()` macros that YOU MUST REPLACE with working code.

Example - if you see:
```rust
pub fn grind_damage(attached_energy: u32) -> i32 { todo!() }
// ATTACK_1_TEXT: "Does 10 damage times the amount of Energy attached"
```

You MUST use the edit tool to change it to:
```rust
pub fn grind_damage(attached_energy: u32) -> i32 { (10 * attached_energy) as i32 }
```

REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
1. Read the stub file ONCE to find the todo!() functions
2. IMMEDIATELY use the edit tool to replace todo!() with working code
3. Run `cargo check` to verify compilation
4. Run `cargo test` to verify tests pass

DO NOT read the file multiple times"""

# AGENTS.md content (read by Codex at startup)

## Objective
Implement Pokemon TCG card effects in Rust by replacing `todo!()` stubs with working code.

## Key Patterns

### Card Identification
Use `def_id_matches(&card.def_id, "DF", NUMBER)` to match specific cards:
```rust
if def_id_matches(&card.def_id, "DF", 23) {
    // This is Dragon Frontiers card #23
}
```

### Attack Implementation
Attacks go in the `attack_override` function. Return damage values directly:
```rust
pub fn some_attack_damage() -> i32 { 40 }
```

### Poke-Powers/Bodies
Implement in `power_effect` function for activated abilities.

## Workflow
1. Read the stub file to identify `todo!()` locations
2. Edit the file to replace each `todo!()` with implementation
3. Run `cargo check` to verify it compiles
4. Run `cargo test` to verify correctness

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Do NOT read the file multiple times
- Do NOT forget to handle coin flips with the `coin: bool` parameter
- Do NOT return wrong damage types (use i32)
