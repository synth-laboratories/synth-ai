Do NOT try PlayBasic if bench is full.\n- You can only attach ONE energy per turn.\n- After your actions, you MUST use EndTurn.\n- You MUST choose an action that is currently allowed (from available_actions). If you output an illegal action, you lose immediately.\n\nYou must respond with ONLY a JSON action (no extra text):\n- {\"action\": \"PlayBasic\", \"card_id\": <id>} - Play basic to bench\n- {\"action\": \"AttachEnergy\", \"energy_id\": <id>, \"target_id\": <id>} - Attach energy\n- {\"action\": \"DeclareAttack\", \"attack\": \"<name>\"} - Attack with active Pokemon\n- {\"action\": \"EndTurn\"} - End your turn\n- {\"action\": \"ChooseActive\", \"card_id\": <id>} - Setup: choose active\n- {\"action\": \"ChooseBench\", \"card_ids\": [<id>, ...]} - Setup: choose bench\n"

        "reasoning": "We have to parse the state. Phase: Main, turn P1. Available actions list shows \"Attach Energy: ENERGY-FIRE (id:50) -> targets available\". Then \"Attacks available: - Hypnosis: 0 damage, Cost: [Psychic]\". Then \"End Turn: Available\". Then \"available_actions: [Attack (1), EndTurn]\". So we have two possible actions: Attack (presumably using Hypnosis) or EndTurn. The attach energy is listed but not in available_actions? The list says \"Attach Energy: ENERGY-FIRE (id:50) -> targets available\". But then available_actions only includes Attack and EndTurn. Possibly the system expects we can only choose from those listed. The instruction says we must select only legal actions based on the current available_actions list. So we cannot attach energy because not in list. So we can either Attack or EndTurn. Attack is Hypnosis costing Psychic energy. Our active is df-061-ralts (Psychic) with ENERGY-PSYCHIC attached (id:41). So we have Psychic energy, cost matches. Attack does 0 damage, but maybe it has effect? Not relevant. But we can attack. Usually you'd want to attack if possible. Since damage is 0, maybe no effect. But still it's an attack. Could also end turn. The goal is to win. Attacking does nothing but uses attack. Might be okay. There's no downside. Probably better to attack to use the turn. So choose DeclareAttack with attack \"Hypnosis\". The JSON format: {\"action\": \"DeclareAttack\", \"attack\": \"Hypnosis\"}.\n\nAfter that we must EndTurn? The instruction says after your actions, you MUST use EndTurn. But we can only output one action? The system expects a single JSON action. Usually you can only output one action per turn. The instruction: \"After your actions, you MUST use EndTurn.\" Means you should end turn after performing any other actions. But you can only output one action? In previous tasks, you can output multiple actions sequentially? Usually you output a single JSON. But maybe you can output multiple actions separated? The spec says respond with ONLY a JSON action. So we need to choose one action. Probably we need to choose EndTurn if we cannot attach energy. But we could also attack then end turn, but that would be two actions. Not allowed. The instruction \"After your actions, you MUST use EndTurn.\" Means you"

Ralts is Psychic type, maybe has attack requiring Psychic energy? Not given. Could attach Psychic energy to active or bench. Also could play trainer TV Reporter maybe draws cards? Not sure effect. Probably want to attach energy to active to prepare attack. So choose AttachEnergy with a Psychic energy to active (ID 4). Choose one of the Psychic energies, say id 41. Action: {\"action\":\"AttachEnergy\",\"energy_id\":41,\"target_id\":4}. Then after that must EndTurn, but we can only do one action before EndTurn? The rules: after your actions, you MUST use EndTurn. But we can output only one action? The instruction: \"You must respond with ONLY a JSON action\". So we need to choose a single action. Probably attach energy then later end turn automatically? But they require EndTurn after actions, but we can only output one action per turn. Usually you can do multiple actions before ending turn, but the system expects a single action. In previous similar tasks, you can output a sequence? But spec says only a JSON action. So we need to output the action we want now; the system will then present next turn with updated actions including EndTurn. So we choose AttachEnergy."

Attack available: Hypnosis does 0 damage, cost Psychic. Active Ralts has Psychic energy attached (id:41). So can attack. But 0 damage does nothing. Might be okay but maybe better to play trainer to draw cards? Trainer is TV Reporter likely draws a card. We have two copies. Probably best to play a trainer to draw. Then end turn. So choose PlayTrainer with one of the IDs. Choose id:21. Action JSON: {\"action\":\"PlayTrainer\",\"card_id\":21}? Wait format: The allowed actions list includes \"Play Trainer\". The output format defined earlier only includes PlayBasic, AttachEnergy, DeclareAttack, EndTurn, ChooseActive, ChooseBench. There's no PlayTrainer action defined! The developer instructions only list those actions. However available_actions includes PlayTrainer, so we must output a JSON action that matches? The spec didn't include PlayTrainer, but we must follow available_actions. Possibly they omitted but we need to output something like {\"action\":\"PlayTrainer\",\"card_id\":21}. The instruction says respond with ONLY a JSON action (no extra text) and list of possible actions includes PlayTrainer. So we should output that.\n\nThus choose PlayTrainer id 21."

Could attach energy to something. We have two energies: Fire and Psychic. Could attach Psychic to active (already has one, but could attach second? Ralts may need only one for Hypnosis. Could attach to bench Jynx to prepare. Jynx likely needs Psychic? Not sure. But we can also play Snorlax to bench. Bench currently has one slot used (Jynx). Bench capacity 5, so we can play Snorlax. Also can play trainer TV reporter (maybe draws cards). Usually better to develop board. Since we have attack of 0 damage, maybe we want to attach energy to active to allow future attack? But we don't know attacks of Ralts beyond Hypnosis. Might be better to play Snorlax to bench. Also we could attach Psychic to Jynx to prepare attack later. Or attach Fire to something? No Pokemon needing fire. Probably attach Psychic to Jynx.\n\nWe can only do one action before EndTurn. Choose best: Play Basic Snorlax to bench. That expands board. Then EndTurn.\n\nThus output PlayBasic with card_id 17."

Hypnosis does 0 damage, likely cause status? But we can still attack. Might be better to attach energy to something? We have two energies: Fire and Psychic. Could attach Psychic to bench Jynx (Psychic) to enable its attack later? But we don't know Jynx's attacks. Probably better to attack now? Attack does 0 damage, not helpful. Could attach Psychic to Jynx to prepare for later. Or attach Fire to Snorlax (Colorless) maybe needed for its attack. Unknown. Since we have attack available, we could attack now, but 0 damage does nothing. Might be better to attach energy then end turn. The rules: you can only attach one energy per turn. You also can attack after attaching? In Main phase, you can do multiple actions: attach energy, play trainer, then attack, then end turn. So we could attach energy then attack. But attack cost is Psychic, we have that already. So we could attach Psychic to Jynx then attack with Ralts. That seems fine.\n\nWe need to output a single JSON action, not multiple. The instruction: \"After your actions, you MUST use EndTurn.\" But we can only output one action? Actually we need to output a single JSON action per turn? The system expects one action. Probably we need to choose one action now; then later will be prompted again. So choose best immediate action. I'd attach Psychic energy to Jynx (bench). That uses one energy. Then next turn we can attack. So output AttachEnergy with energy_id 44 target_id 11 (Jynx ID)."

Then \"Attacks available: - Hypnosis: 0 damage, Cost: [Psychic]\". Then \"End Turn: Available\". Then \"available_actions: [Attack (1), EndTurn]\". So we have two possible actions: Attack (presumably using Hypnosis) or EndTurn. The attach energy is listed but not in available_actions? The list says \"Attach Energy: ENERGY-FIRE (id:50) -> targets available\". But then available_actions only includes Attack and EndTurn. Possibly the system expects we can only choose from those listed. The instruction says we must select only legal actions based on the current available_actions list. So we cannot attach energy because not in list. So we can either Attack or EndTurn. Attack is Hypnosis costing Psychic energy. Our active is df-061-ralts (Psychic) with ENERGY-PSYCHIC attached (id:41). So we have Psychic energy, cost matches. Attack does 0 damage, but maybe it has effect? Not relevant. But we can attack. Usually you'd want to attack if possible. Since damage is 0, maybe no effect. But still it's an attack. Could also end turn. The goal is to win. Attacking does nothing but uses attack. Might be okay. There's no downside. Probably better to attack to use the turn. So choose DeclareAttack with attack \"Hypnosis\". The JSON format: {\"action\": \"DeclareAttack\", \"attack\": \"Hypnosis\"}.\n\nAfter that we must EndTurn? The instruction says after your actions, you MUST use EndTurn. But we can only output one action? The system expects a single JSON action. Usually you can only output one action per turn. The instruction: \"After your actions, you MUST use EndTurn.\" Means you should end turn after performing any other actions. But you can only output one action? In previous tasks, you can output multiple actions sequentially? Usually you output a single JSON. But maybe you can output multiple actions separated? The spec says respond with ONLY a JSON action. So we need to choose one action. Probably we need to choose EndTurn if we cannot attach energy. But we could also attack then end turn, but that would be two actions. Not allowed. The instruction \"After your actions, you MUST use EndTurn.\" Means you"
