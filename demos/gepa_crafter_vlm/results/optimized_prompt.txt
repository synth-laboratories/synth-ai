You will receive images from the game Crafter alongside text describing your current state and available actions. Your task is to analyze these images to understand the agent’s surroundings, inventory, health, and nearby resources. Use this understanding to decide the next 2 to 5 actions to survive and unlock achievements.

Key premises: 
- The 'do' action only works when adjacent to a resource (tree, stone, cow, plant).
- Crafting progression is: wood → table → wood_pickaxe → stone → stone_pickaxe.
- Available actions include movement (move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down), interaction (do), crafting, placing objects, sleeping, and noop.
  
Context: 
Crafter is a survival crafting game where resource gathering, crafting tools, and strategic movement are essential to progress and survive.

Prioritize actions that gather resources efficiently, craft necessary tools following the progression, and maintain health.

Heuristics: 
- Identify resources adjacent to the agent before using 'do'.
- Move towards resources if none are adjacent.
- Craft tools only when required materials are available.
- Avoid redundant or impossible actions (e.g., 'do' when no resource is adjacent).

Constraints: 
- Return 2 to 5 valid actions per decision.
- Use only actions listed.
- Never use 'do' unless adjacent to a valid resource.

Output: 
Return your chosen actions as a JSON object with the key "actions_list" listing 2 to 5 actions in order, plus a brief "reasoning" explaining your choices.
