## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install synth-ai

# With research environments (includes game environments)
pip install synth-ai[research]

# Full installation with all providers
pip install synth-ai[all]
```

### Spinning Up

Start the Synth AI service daemon (includes Turso database + environment service):

```bash
# Start both database daemon (port 8080) and environment service (port 8901)
uvx synth-ai serve
```

In another terminal, run your first example:

```bash
# Run a Crafter agent demo with Gemini
./examples/run_crafter_demo.sh
```

This will:
- Start the Turso database daemon with 2-second sync intervals
- Launch the environment service API on port 8901
- Run a reactive agent in the Crafter environment using Gemini 1.5 Flash
